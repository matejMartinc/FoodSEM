As selenium deficiencies in celiac disease are observed, the aim of the study was to determine the selenium content in 27 grain gluten-free products available on the European Union (EU) market. Moreover, selenium content in products based on popular gluten-free cereals like corn, rice, and buckwheat and in relatively new or less popular products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was compared. Selenium content in the tested products ranged from 0.9 to 24.5 <U+03BC>g/100 g. The average content of selenium in products based on popular gluten-free cereals was 2.8 <U+03BC>g/100 g and in products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was 10.8 <U+03BC>g/100 g. It indicates that products based on less popular grains, especially on oat, should be more frequently chosen as a source of selenium by people on gluten-free diet than traditionally consumed gluten-free grains.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Dairy sheep have been farmed traditionally in the Mediterranean basin in southern Europe, central Europe, eastern Europe, and in Near East countries. Currently, dairy sheep farming systems vary from extensive to intensive according to the economic relevance of the production chain and the specific environment and breed. Modern breeding programs were conceived in the 1960s. The most efficient selection scheme for local dairy sheep breeds is based on pyramidal management of the population with the breeders of nucleus flocks at the top, where pedigree and official milk recording, artificial insemination, controlled natural mating, and breeding value estimation are carried out to generate genetic progress. The genetic progress is then transferred to the commercial flocks through artificial insemination or natural-mating rams. Increasing milk yield is still the most profitable breeding objective for several breeds. Almost all milk is used for cheese production and, consequently, milk content traits are very important. Moreover, other traits are gaining interest for selection: machine milking ability and udder morphology, resistance to diseases (mastitis, internal parasites, scrapie), and traits related to the nutritional value of milk (fatty acid composition). Current breeding programs based on the traditional quantitative approach have achieved appreciable genetic gains for milk yield. In many cases, further selection goals such as milk composition, udder morphology, somatic cell count, and scrapie resistance have been implemented. However, the possibility of including other traits of selective interest is limited by high recording costs. Also, the organizational effort needed to apply the traditional quantitative approach limits the diffusion of current selection programs outside the European Mediterranean area. In this context, the application of selection schemes assisted by molecular information, to improve either traditional dairy traits or traits costly to record, seems to be attractive in dairy sheep. At the moment, the most effective strategy seems to be the strengthening of research projects aimed at finding causal mutations along the genes affecting traits of economic importance. However, genome-wide selection seems to be unfeasible in most dairy sheep breeds.  [/INST] Sure thing, the entities regarding food are listed as follows:  milk.

[INST]  Extract all food-related terms from the text:   Over the years, doubts have arisen concerning the use of milk as a calcium source in the prevention of osteoporosis, particularly because of potential offsetting effects of protein and phosphorus. Thus, a new milk product with a higher calcium content and lower contents of protein, phosphorus, and energy was developed. A controlled crossover study was done to determine the way in which substitution of the new milk product (860 mL) for normal milk (1000 mL) in the diet of healthy adults affected the urinary excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline. Short-term consumption of the product significantly lowered 24-h urinary calcium excretion by approximately 0.65 +/- 0.19 mmol/d (means +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). The ratio of fasting urinary hydroxyproline to creatinine did not decrease, indicating no significant reduction of bone resorption in our subjects. Elderly people in particular might benefit from the new product because it reduces their calcium loss as well as their intake of protein, phosphorus, energy, and liquid volume.

This review aims to address the potential mechanisms of action of dietary polyphenols in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity based on in vitro and in vivo studies, and to provide a comprehensive overview of the anti-diabetic effects of commonly consumed dietary polyphenols including polyphenol-rich mixed diets, tea and coffee, chocolate and cocoa, cinnamon, grape, pomegranate, red wine, berries and olive oil, with a focus on human clinical trials. Dietary polyphenols may inhibit <U+03B1>-amylase and <U+03B1>-glucosidase, inhibit glucose absorption in the intestine by sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), stimulate insulin secretion and reduce hepatic glucose output. Polyphenols may also enhance insulin-dependent glucose uptake, activate 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), modify the microbiome and have anti-inflammatory effects. However, human epidemiological and intervention studies have shown inconsistent results. Further intervention studies are essential to clarify the conflicting findings and confirm or refute the anti-diabetic effects of dietary polyphenols.

Obesity plays a central role in morbidity and mortality of diseases of multiple organs and systems, and it is a major contributor to the growing incidence of cancer. There is now sufficient level of evidence for the association between overweight and 11 types of cancer, among which are two of the most common cancers worldwide, those of the colorectum and postmenopausal breast. Sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, and excessive alcohol intake also account for the burden of cancer by promoting obesity. The risk of specific types of cancer is also directly influenced, regardless of the magnitude of adiposity, by physical inactivity, consumption of red meat, processed meat and ultra-processed foods, dairy products, alcohol, whole grain cereals, nuts, vegetables, and fruits. Type 2 diabetes is another global health threat closely associated with obesity that boosts the risk of cancer driven by high BMI.

[INST]  Identify all food items referenced in the text:   It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate cancers are greater than the Japanese.

They differ between themselves in term of nutrients, calories, and bioactive constituents. Therefore, some of them are unhealthy foods, whereas others do not affect health and still others are healthy foods. One wonders which chocolate and other cocoa derivatives can be considered as biofunctional food products. This review explores the constituents of cocoa and chocolate and summarizes evidence about the role of cocoa and chocolate components on human health and particularly on reproduction. On the basis of the literature review, it can be asserted that some kinds of cocoa products have favorable effects on human health at different stages of life. Women seem to be particularly favored by consuming of cocoa products, and chocolate with specific features can also be a good supplementary source of energy for pregnant woman. However, many aspects remain to be investigated and others are still to be clarified.

Ginger, one of the most widely consumed spices, has shown beneficial effects against obesity and related metabolic disorders. The present study aimed to examine whether the antiobesity effect of ginger is associated with energy metabolism. Mice were maintained on either a normal control diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without 500 mg/kg (w/w) ginger supplementation. After 16 weeks, ginger supplementation alleviated the HFD-induced increases in body weight, fat accumulation, and levels of serum glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol. Indirect calorimetry showed that ginger administration significantly increased the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and heat production in both diet models. Furthermore, ginger administration corrected the HFD-induced changes in concentrations of intermediates in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Moreover, ginger enhanced brown adipose tissue function and activated white adipose tissue browning by altering the gene expression and protein levels of some brown and beige adipocyte-selective markers. Additionally, stimulation of the browning program by ginger may be partly regulated by the sirtuin-1 (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> coactivator 1<U+03B1> (PGC-1<U+03B1>) pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that dietary ginger prevents body weight gain by remodeling whole-body energy metabolism and inducing browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Thus, ginger is an edible plant that plays a role in the therapeutic treatment of obesity and related disorders.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms found in the text:   Intakes of dairy produce show enormous diversity between regions, cultures, and individuals around the world. At the geographic level, intake maps closely onto the distribution of lactase persistence (LP), a genetic trait that allows milk to be consumed beyond the weaning period without gastrointestinal side effects. The LP trait has been independently selected at least 4 times and is under rapid positive selection, which shows that dairy consumption has positive survival benefits. For people lacking the LP trait, the fermentation of milk into yogurt and related products (a process known for <U+2265>8500 y) aids milk digestion through the breakdown of some lactose and the provision of <U+03B2>-galactosidase, which remains active in the gastrointestinal tract. In global ecologic comparisons, milk and dairy intakes are strongly associated with adult height, and many international advisory bodies recommend the consumption of 400-500 mL milk equivalents/d. There are very few countries where such high intakes are met, and in populations in whom intakes are much lower there is evidence of adaptations that help to maintain bone health with surprisingly low intakes. Despite concerns that the high-saturated-fat content of full-fat dairy products would promote heart disease, recent meta-analyses show that dairy consumption is neutral or beneficial for weight control, coronary disease, diabetes, hypertension, and most cancers.

The goal of the First Global Summit on the Health Effects of Yogurt was to review and evaluate the strength of current scientific knowledge with regard to the health benefits of yogurt and to identify areas where further research is needed. The evidence base for the benefits of yogurt in promoting bone health, maintaining health throughout the life cycle, improving diet quality, and reducing the incidence of chronic diseases, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, was presented. When assessing a complex food matrix, rather than specific nutrients, scientists and consumers are faced with new challenges as to how a food item's quality or necessity would be judged as part of an individual's whole diet. To tackle this challenge, speakers described methods for assessing the nutrient density of foods and its application to yogurt, use of yogurt for lactose intolerance, and the cost-effectiveness of yogurt and dairy products in reducing health care expenses.

We assessed the effects of consuming (1) common breakfast beverages (water, sugar-sweetened coffee, reduced-energy orange juice (OJ), and low-fat milk (LFM)); and (2) fat-free, low-fat, and whole milk with breakfast on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses in adults who were overweight/obese. Forty-six subjects (33F/13M, body mass index: 32.5 <U+00B1> 0.7 kg/m<U+00B2>, age: 50 <U+00B1> 1 years, mean <U+00B1> SEMs) consumed a standard sandwich with one of the six beverages on separate mornings in randomized order. The test beverages (except water) each contained 12 g digestible carbohydrate. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured from blood obtained pre- and post-meal at 30-min intervals for 4 h and incremental areas under the curve (AUC) were computed. We found (1) among different beverage types, glucose AUC was higher for coffee versus water, OJ, and LFM. Insulin AUC was higher for coffee and LFM versus OJ and water; (2) Glucose AUCs were not different among water and milks while insulin AUC was higher for milks versus water.

Trained dietitians interviewed 136 patients diagnosed with GC, and the same number of controls were selected by matching sex, age and hospital. A significant decrease in GC risk was observed with increased intake of Baiechu kimchi (prepared with salted Chinese cabbage and red pepper, etc.), Baiechu kimchi-stew, garlic, mushroom and soybean milk. On the contrary, a significant increase in the risk of GC was observed with increased intake of cooked rice with bean, charcoal grilled beef, pollack soup, Kkakduki (a kind of kimchi prepared with salted radish and red pepper, etc.), Dongchimi (a kind of kimchi prepared with radish and a large quantity of salt water) and cooked spinach. In food groups, increased intake of soybean products was associated with decreased risk of GC. Intake of citrus fruits rather than total fruits was shown to have a protective effect on the risk of GC, but was not significant. In this study, intake of total vegetables was shown to have a protective effect, whereas high nitrate-containing vegetables increased the risk of GC. In conclusion, our study suggests that the risk of GC decreased with high consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits, whereas high consumption of foods rich in nitrate and carcinogenic substances produced during the cooking process increased the risk of GC.

[INST]  Extract all food-related references from the text:   The potential protective and therapeutic effects of bST during coliform mastitis in periparturient cows were evaluated. In a first study, 19 cows, classified as moderate or severe responders based on the respiratory burst activity of blood neutrophils, were treated with recombinant bST or vehicle 48 h after intramammary inoculation of Escherichia coli. Clinical status and changes in milk production and composition were compared in the four groups. In a second study, 8 cows received bST or vehicle 7 d before bacterial challenge. During mastitis, losses in milk production and compositional changes were most pronounced in infected glands and in severe responders. Milk production of bST cows recovered better than that of placebo cows. Recovery of milk components was accelerated in severe responders treated with bST, but not in moderate responders. Pretreatment of severe responders with bST enhanced milk production before infection, protected the mammary glands from excessive loss of milk during the subsequently induced coliform mastitis, and accelerated normalization of milk composition. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of bST upon normalization of milk production and composition in periparturient cows suffering from coliform mastitis seem to be restricted to the severe responders. In severe responders that had been treated with bST, changes observed during mastitis resembled those in moderate responders treated with the placebo.

The effect of dietary fats (coconut oil, butter, traditional stick margarine, soybean oil, canola oil) differing in fatty acid profile on this antiatherogenic process was assessed with respect to plasma lipids; exogenous and endogenous lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activities; and LCAT, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and scavenger receptor B class-1 (SR-B1) mRNA abundance. Golden-Syrian hamsters were fed a nonpurified (6.25 g/100 g fat) diet containing an additional 10 g/100 g experimental fat and 0.1 g/100 g cholesterol for 6 wk. Canola and soybean oils significantly lowered serum HDL cholesterol concentrations relative to butter. Canola oil, relative to butter, resulted in higher exogenous LCAT activity, and both soybean and canola oils significantly increased hepatic apo A-I and SR-B1 mRNA abundance. Butter, relative to margarine, coconut and soybean oils, significantly increased serum non-HDL cholesterol concentrations. Endogenous and exogenous LCAT, CETP, and PLTP activities did not differ in hamsters fed margarine or saturated fat diets, despite lower hepatic LCAT, apo A-I, and SR-B1 mRNA abundance, suggesting that changes in available substrate and/or modification to the LCAT protein may have been involved in lipoprotein changes. These results suggest that lower HDL cholesterol concentrations, as a result of canola and soybean oil feeding, may not be detrimental due to increases in components involved in the reverse cholesterol transport process in these hamsters and may retard the progression of atherosclerosis.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food present in the text:   Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.

This study aimed to characterise the street food environment in Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u, Moldova, including the vending sites and vendors, food availability and nutritional composition of foods and beverages. All street food vending sites (single point of sale) located in a 1-km buffer centred on the main public market were systematically selected (n 439; n 328 participants). Data on vending sites' characteristics (mobility, type of physical set-up and access to electricity), operating periods and food availability were collected. Samples of the most commonly available foods of unknown composition were collected (twenty-eight home-made and twenty-four industrial). Macronutrients, Na and K were quantified through chemical analysis. Fruits, beverages and food other than fruits were available in 2<U+00B7>5, 74<U+00B7>3 and 80<U+00B7>8 % of the vending sites, respectively. Among the latter, 66<U+00B7>4 % sold only industrial foods (e.g. pretzels, biscuits, wafers, chocolate and ice cream), 21<U+00B7>5 % only home-made (e.g. savoury and sweet pastries) and 12<U+00B7>1 % both. Home-made foods presented larger serving sizes and energy/serving (median kJ/serving: 1312<U+00B7>5 v. 670<U+00B7>3, P = 0<U+00B7>022); industrial foods were more energy-dense (median kJ/100 g: 1797<U+00B7>0 v. 1269<U+00B7>8, P = 0<U+00B7>002). High SFA, trans-fat and Na contents were found, reaching 10<U+00B7>9 g/serving, 1<U+00B7>4 g/serving and 773<U+00B7>7 mg/serving, respectively. Soft drinks and alcoholic beverages were available in 80<U+00B7>7 and 42<U+00B7>0 % of the vending sites selling beverages, respectively. Concluding, industrial snacks and home-made pastries high in Na and unhealthy fat were frequent in Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u.

[INST]  Identify all food items mentioned in the text:   Long chain omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to suppress growth of most cancer cells. In vivo, alpha linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3) can be converted to EPA or DHA. We hypothesized that substituting canola oil (10% ALA) for the corn oil (1% ALA) in the diet of cancer bearing mice would slow tumor growth by increasing n-3 fatty acids in the diet. Sixty nude mice received MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells and were fed a diet containing 8% w/w corn oil until the mean tumor volume was 60 mm3. The dietary fat of half of the tumor bearing mice was then changed to 8% w/w canola oil. Compared to mice that consumed the corn oil containing diet, the mice that consumed the canola oil containing diet had significantly more EPA and DHA in both tumors and livers, and the mean tumor growth rate and cell proliferation in the tumor were significantly slower (P<0.05). About 25 days after diet change, mice that consumed the corn oil diet stopped gaining weight, whereas the mice that consumed the canola oil diet continued normal weight gain. Use of canola oil instead of corn oil in the diet may be a reasonable means to increase consumption of n-3 fatty acids with potential significance for slowing growth of residual cancer cells in cancer survivors.

Olive oil, a potent dietary chemopreventive agent, control colon cancer, however, its role in epigenetic therapy remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of olive oil in a preclinical model of colon cancer by targeting genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. DMH was used to induce colon cancer in rats; while olive oil was given to separate group of rats along with DMH treatment. Tumor burden and incidence in DMH and DMH + olive oil-treated rats was observed by macroscopic examination and histoarchitectural studies. Potent anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic activity of olive oil was explored by gene expression and immunohistochemical studies. The effect of olive oil on epigenetic alterations was examined by detecting promoter methylation with MS-HRM and dysregulation of miRNA by TaqMan MicroRNA Assay. We observed that olive oil administration lowered tumor incidence and inhibited the development of tumors in DMH-treated rats. Olive oil markedly decreased the expression of inflammatory and angiogenic markers and restored the expression of pro-apoptotic markers in DMH-treated rats. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation, deviant miRNA pattern and miRNA silencing mediated by aberrant DNA methylation was also seen in DMH-treated rats, which was potentially reversible upon olive oil treatment. Our study concludes that olive oil may play a role in the epigenetic therapy by altering NF-<U+03BA>B and apoptotic pathways via targeting noncoding RNAs and methylation machinery that affecting epigenome to prevent colon carcinogenesis.

Also, some intervention studies have shown a blood pressure-lowering effect of milk products and dairy proteins. Milk peptides are formed from milk proteins by enzymatic breakdown by digestive enzymes or by the proteinases formed by lactobacilli during the fermentation of milk. Several milk peptides have been shown to have antihypertensive effects in animal and in clinical studies. The most studied mechanism underlying the antihypertensive effects of milk peptides is inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Milk peptides may also have other additional mechanisms to lower blood pressure such as opioid-like activities and mineral-binding and antithrombotic properties.

We examined the fluid intake-bladder cancer relationship in the Los Angeles bladder cancer case-control study. A total of 1,586 cases and their age-, sex-, and race-matched neighborhood controls were interviewed in-person from 1987 to 1999. Information on total fluid intake was derived from the consumption of specific fluids including water, coffee, tea, alcohol, milk, juice, hot chocolate and soda. Total fluid intake was not associated with bladder cancer. Daily water intake was associated with a slight decrease in bladder cancer risk, with the protection more pronounced among women (p for trend = 0.039) than among men (p for trend = 0.62). Compared to drinking <1 glass of water per day, drinking > or =6 glasses/day was associated with 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-1.22) times the risk of bladder cancer among all subjects, 0.94 (0.67-1.32) times the risk among men, and 0.69 (0.36-1.33) times the risk among women. The water intake-bladder cancer association also seemed to be modified by daytime urination frequency with significant inverse association among subjects who urinated > or =6 times/day (p for trend = 0.015), but not among those who urinated less frequently. Similarly, the protection from water intake was confined to women who did not experience nocturia and to men who did.

It is important source of vitamin C, potassium, folic acid, and carotenoids, such as lycopene. Carotenoids are the pigments synthesized during fruit ripening and responsible for the final red color of the tomato. Consumption of tomato and tomato-based products contribute to the absorption of carotenoids and lycopenes in human serum. Lycopene is chemically acyclic carotene with 11 conjugated double bonds, normally in transconfiguration while isomerization occur in blood plasma for its better absorption. It has ability for adenosine deaminase inhibition that plays important role in the regression of tumor. Tomato also contain other active compounds, namely, neoxanthin, lutein, <U+03B1>-cryptoxanthin, <U+03B1>-carotene, <U+03B2>-carotene, cyclolycopene, and <U+03B2>-carotene 5, 6-epoxide. These components provide synergistic effect against various threats but still need further attention of the researchers. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have elucidated the potential of tomato against variety of metabolic syndromes. Latest research highlights the relationship between consuming tomato and its products with reduced risk of various maladies like obesity, hyperglycemic and hypercholesterolemic attributes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer insurgences.

The DGAs note that children are consuming 100% fruit juice within recommendations (that is, 120 to 180 mL/d for children aged 1 to 6 y and 236 to 355 mL/d for children aged 7 to 18 y). Evidence shows that compared to nonconsumers, those who consume 100% fruit juice come closer to meeting daily fruit needs and have better diet quality. In children, 100% fruit juice is associated with increased intakes of nutrients such as vitamin C, folate, and potassium. When consumed within the DGA recommendations, 100% fruit juice is not associated with overweight/obesity or childhood dental caries and does not compromise fiber intake. Preliminary data suggest that polyphenols in some 100% fruit juices may inhibit absorption of naturally occurring sugars. Given its role in promoting health and in helping people meet fruit needs, experts participating in a roundtable discussion agreed that there is no science-based reason to restrict access to 100% fruit juice in public health nutrition policy and programs such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

[INST]  Extract all food-related references from the text:   The aim of this review was to focus on the complex relationships between milk and dairy products intake and bone health, with particular emphasis on osteoporosis. The literature was extensively examined to provide an objective overview of the most significant achievements on the subject. Osteoporosis can be defined as a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent increase in fracture risk. Although the major determinants of peak bone mass and strength are genetic, major factors during childhood and adolescence may affect the ability to achieve peak bone mass. These include nutrition, particularly calcium and protein intake, physical activity, endocrine status, as well as exposure to a wide variety of risk factors. The role of calcium intake in determining bone mineral mass is well recognized to be the most critical nutritional factor to achieve optimal peak bone mass. The greatest amount of dietary calcium is obtained from milk and dairy foods, which also provide the human diet with vitamin D (particularly for products fortified with vitamin D), potassium, and other macro- and micronutrients. Although studies supporting the beneficial effects of milk or calcium on bone health are predominant in the literature, perplexity or discordance on this subject was expressed by some authors. Discordant data, mainly on the risk of fractures, provided limited proof of the unfavorable effect of dairy intake. More often, discordant works indicate no effect of dairy consumption on bone safety. Some considerations can be drawn from this viewpoint. Milk and dairy products are an optimal source of calcium as well as of other limiting nutrients (e.g., potassium and magnesium), with important effects on bone health. Bioactive components occurring in milk and dairy products may play an essential role on bone metabolism, as shown by in vivo and in vitro studies on colostrum acidic proteins and milk basic proteins. Calcium intake positively affects bone mass and is crucial in childhood and youth for correct bone development. In elderly people, calcium intake as well as vitamin D availability should be carefully checked. As a general conclusion, calcium is essential for bone health, although it will not prevent bone loss due to other factors; in this context, milk and dairy foods are bioavailable, relatively inexpensive sources of calcium for the human diet.

[INST]  Find all food-related entities mentioned in the text:   A causal relationship between metabolic syndrome and methylglyoxal (MG) has been suggested. Consumption of coffee and other types of beverages has been known to produce MG, thus resulting in both nutritional and health concerns. The purpose of this study was to determine the ideal combination of coffee, cream, and sugar in order to minimize MG consumption. Four types of black coffee were tested: espresso, bold, mild, and a decaffeinated mild roast. Sugar and/or cream were added to the coffee samples to test whether MG levels were altered. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, the concentration of MG in various coffee samples was determined. The espresso coffee sample was found to contain the highest level of MG at 230.9 microM. The bold coffee roast had the 2nd highest amount of MG, followed by the mild and decaffeinated varieties. Adding cream to bold coffee significantly reduced its MG level in comparison to the coffee sample without cream. On the other hand, the addition of sugar to the bold coffee did not further increase the MG level in the samples. The cellular damaging effect of MG was shown as there were decreased numbers of cultured HEK-293 cells after 24 h of MG treatment (100 and 300 microM), which is consistent with an increased cell apoptosis induced by MG treatment (100 and 300 microM). Due to the overconsumption of exogenous MG, drinking an excess of any type of coffee poses health risks.

However, no significant data had been collected on the frequency of specific IgE antibodies to fruits in these patients and the frequency of a history of fruit intolerance. Serum samples of 136 patients with well-documented, clinically relevant, immediate-type hypersensitivity against latex proteins were analyzed for IgE antibodies against a panel of different fruits. Patient history of food intolerance was documented by a standardized questionnaire. Fruit-specific IgE antibodies were detected in 69.1% of serum samples. Cross-reacting IgE antibodies recognizing latex and fruit allergens (papaya, avocado, banana, chestnut, passion fruit, fig, melon, mango, kiwi, pineapple, peach, and tomato) were demonstrated by RAST-inhibition tests. Of our patients, 42.5% reported allergic symptoms after ingestion of these fruits and a total of 112 intolerance reactions were recorded. However, fruit-specific IgE antibodies were detected only in serum samples from 32.1% of the patients who perceived symptoms due to these fruits. Thus, serologic tests seem to be of low significance for prediction o food allergy in latex-allergic patients.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   The contributions of food items and food groups as risk factors in a previously reported case-control study of diet and colo-rectal cancer have been analyzed. The study included 348 patients with colon cancer, 194 with rectal cancer, 542 neighbourhood controls individually matched to the cases on the basis of age and sex and a second control series of 535 surgical hospital controls frequency matched to the cases. For colon cancer, as in the previous analysis, the major risk factor was saturated fat, individual food items or groups failing to make a significant contribution to the risk. In particular there was no protective effect of dietary fibre and, for cruciferous vegetables, only a minor protective effect in females. No individual cruciferous vegetable made an important contribution to this effect. For rectal cancer, on the other hand, a significant effect of saturated fat, independent of other food items or groups, was only found for females in the highest consumption category. For males, consumption of eggs, beef and veal significantly increased risk but not consumption of pork, while for females, there was a non-significant increase in risk with consumption of eggs, no increased risk with consumption of beef or veal and a significantly increased risk with consumption of pork. There was no protective effect of dietary fibre or of cruciferous vegetables for rectal cancer, but in females, there was a significantly increased risk for consumption of beer, though this was somewhat reduced when controlled for consumption of saturated fat. There was no indication of an effect of alcohol in either sex or of beer in males. Thus, these results confirm the previous report in showing a significant effect of saturated fat in increasing risk of colon cancer but suggest a contribution of meats to risk of rectal cancer.

[INST]  Extract all food items mentioned in the text:   We developed a comprehensive composition database of 629 cereal-based gluten free (GF) products available in Spain. Information on ingredients and nutritional composition was retrieved from food package labels. GF products were primarily composed of rice and/or corn flour, and 90% of them included added rice starch. The most common added fat was sunflower oil (present in one third of the products), followed by palm fat, olive oil, and cocoa. Only 24.5% of the products had the nutrition claim "no added sugar". Fifty-six percent of the GF products had sucrose in their formulation. Xanthan gum was the most frequently employed fiber, appearing in 34.2% of the GF products, followed by other commonly used such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (23.1%), guar gum (19.7%), and vegetable gums (19.6%). Macronutrient analysis revealed that 25.4% of the products could be labeled as a source of fiber. Many of the considered GF food products showed very high contents of energy (33.5%), fats (28.5%), saturated fatty acids (30.0%), sugars (21.6%), and salt (28.3%).

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food present in the text:   Food fortification is designed to improve the nutritional profile of diets. The purpose of this research was to estimate the potential nutrient contribution of fortified maize flour, oil, rice, salt, and wheat flour in 153 countries, using the national intake (or availability) of the food and the nutrient levels required for fortification. This was done under two scenarios-maximum, where 100% of the food is assumed to be industrially processed and fortified, and realistic, where the maximum value is adjusted based on the percent of the food that is industrially processed and fortified. Under the maximum scenario, the median Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) met ranged from 22-75% for 14 nutrients (vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, D, E, folic acid and calcium, fluoride, iron, selenium and zinc), and 338% for iodine. In the realistic scenario, the median EARs met were 181% for iodine and <35% for the other nutrients. In both scenarios, the median Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) met were <55% for all nutrients. Under the realistic scenario, no country exceeded 100% of the UL for any nutrient. Current fortification practices of the five foods of interest have the global potential to contribute up to 15 nutrients to the diets of people, with minimal risk of exceeding ULs.

We evaluated the relation between a wide range of foods and the risk of RCC in an Italian case-control study including 767 patients (494 men and 273 women) younger than 79 years with incident, histologically confirmed RCC, and 1,534 controls (988 men and 546 women) admitted to the same hospitals as cases for a wide spectrum of acute, non-neoplastic conditions, not related to long term diet modifications. A validated and reproducible food frequency questionnaire, including 78 foods and beverages, plus a separate section on alcohol drinking, was used to assess patients' dietary habits 2 years before diagnosis or hospital admission. Multivariate odds ratios (OR) were obtained after allowance for energy intake and other major confounding factors. A significant direct trend in risk was found for bread (OR = 1.94 for the highest versus the lowest intake quintile), and a modest excess of risk was observed for pasta and rice (OR = 1.29), and milk and yoghurt (OR = 1.27). Poultry (OR = 0.74), processed meat (OR = 0.64) and vegetables (OR = 0.65) were inversely associated with RCC risk. No relation was found for coffee and tea, soups, eggs, red meat, fish, cheese, pulses, potatoes, fruits, desserts and sugars.

[INST]  Extract all food-related terms from the text:   Whey protein promotes weight loss and improves diabetic control, however, less is known of its bioactive components that produce such benefits. We compared the effects of normal protein (control) diet with high protein diets containing whey, or its fractions lactalbumin and lactoferrin, on energy balance and metabolism. Diet-induced obese rats were randomized to isocaloric diets: Control, Whey, Lactalbumin, Lactoferrin, or pair-fed to lactoferrin. Whey and lactalbumin produced transient hypophagia, whereas lactoferrin caused prolonged hypophagia; the hypophagia was likely due to decreased preference. Lactalbumin decreased weight and fat gain. Notably, lactoferrin produced sustained weight and fat loss, and attenuated the reduction in energy expenditure associated with calorie restriction. Lactalbumin and lactoferrin decreased plasma leptin and insulin, and lactalbumin increased peptide YY. Whey, lactalbumin and lactoferrin improved glucose clearance partly through differential upregulation of glucoregulatory transcripts in the liver and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, lactalbumin and lactoferrin decreased hepatic lipidosis partly through downregulation of lipogenic and/or upregulation of <U+03B2>-oxidation transcripts, and differentially modulated cecal bacterial populations. Our findings demonstrate that protein quantity and quality are important for improving energy balance. Dietary lactalbumin and lactoferrin improved energy balance and metabolism, and decreased adiposity, with the effects of lactoferrin being partly independent of caloric intake.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food present in the text:   Specific beverage intake may be associated with the risk of renal cell cancer through a diluting effect of carcinogens, alterations of hormone levels, or other changes in the renal tubular environment, but few prospective studies have examined these associations. We evaluated the associations between coffee, tea, milk, soda and fruit and vegetable juice intakes and renal cell cancer risk in a pooled analysis of 13 prospective studies (530,469 women and 244,483 men). Participants completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. Using the primary data, the study-specific relative risks (RRs) were calculated and then pooled using a random effects model. A total of 1,478 incident renal cell cancer cases were identified during a follow-up of 7-20 years across studies. Coffee consumption was associated with a modestly lower risk of renal cell cancer (pooled multivariate RR for 3 or more 8 oz (237 ml) cups/day versus less than one 8 oz (237 ml) cup/day = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.67-1.05; p value, test for trend = 0.22). Tea consumption was also inversely associated with renal cell cancer risk (pooled multivariate RR for 1 or more 8 oz (237 ml) cups/day versus nondrinkers = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.71-1.02; pvalue, test for trend = 0.04). No clear associations were observed for milk, soda or juice. Our findings provide strong evidence that neither coffee nor tea consumption increases renal cell cancer risk. Instead, greater consumption of coffee and tea may be associated with a lower risk of renal cell cancer. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

[INST]  Identify all food items mentioned in the text:   Soybean (Glycine max) is a vital oilseed legume crop that provides protein and oil for humans and feedstock for animals. Flowering is a prerequisite for seed production. Floral transition, from vegetative to reproductive stage, in a plant, is regulated by environmental (light, temperature) and endogenous factors. In Arabidopsis, Flowering Locus T (FT) protein is shown to be a mobile signal that moves from leaf to shoot apical meristem to induce flowering. However, FTs role in soybean is not fully resolved due to the presence of multiple (ten) homologs in the genome. Two of the ten FT homologs (GmFT2a and GmFT5a) have a role in the floral transition while GmFT1a and GmFT4 suppress soybean flowering. Recent deep sequencing data revealed that six FT homologs are expressed in shoot apical meristem and leaves during floral transition. One FT homolog, GmFT7 showed strong expression during soybean floral transition. Though bioinformatic analyses revealed that GmFT7 had high similarity with GmFT2a, ectopic GmFT7 expression in Arabidopsis could not promote flowering or rescue the late-flowering phenotype of Arabidopsis ft-10 mutant.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Phenolic compounds are a large class of phytochemicals that are widespread in the plant kingdom and known to have antioxidant capacities. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant capacities as well as the content of total soluble phenolics, anthocyanins, tannins, and flavonoids in the fruits and leaves of blueberries and lingonberries growing in Newfoundland. This study also determined the potential neuroprotective effect of extracts from fruits and leaves against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, which is believed to contribute to disorders such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Lingonberry and blueberry plants were found to be rich sources of phenolic compounds. Total antioxidant capacities in terms of radical scavenging activity and reducing power were much higher in leaves of both plants as compared to their fruits. These results were in correlation with phenolic contents including total flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins. Brain-derived cell cultures from rats were prepared and grown for about 2 weeks. Cell cultures were treated with glutamate (100 <U+03BC>M) for 24 h, and the effect of extracts was determined on cells subjected to this excitotoxicity. Glutamate treatment caused approximately 23% cell loss when measured after 24 h of exposure. Whereas lingonberry fruit extract did not provide protection from glutamate toxicity, blueberry fruit extracts were extremely protective. Leaf extracts of both lingonberry and blueberry showed a significant neuroprotective effect. The greater protective effect of leaf extracts was in correlation with the levels of phenolics and antioxidant capacity. These findings suggest that berries or their components may contribute to protecting the brain from various pathologies.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   The Committee on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer of the National Academy of Sciences recently evaluated the role of diet in carcinogenesis. Both epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that a high intake of total fat increases susceptibility to cancer of different sites, particularly the breast and colon. In epidemiological studies frequent consumption of certain fruits and vegetables and in laboratory experiments some components of fruits and vegetables, especially cruciferous vegetables, appear to decrease the incidence of cancers at various sites. In contrast, frequent consumption of salt-cured, salt-pickled, or smoked foods, possibly because they may contain nitrosamines or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, appears to increase the risk of esophageal or stomach cancer. Excessive alcohol consumption among smokers appears to be associated with an elevated risk of cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, larynx, and respiratory tract. Interim dietary guidelines to reduce the risk of cancer were proposed in accordance with these conclusions. No definitive conclusions were reached for other dietary factors, including total calories, cholesterol, fiber, and selenium, nor could the quantitative contribution of diet to overall cancer risk be estimated.

[INST]  Identify all references to food present in the text:   The European Commission asked EFSA for a scientific opinion on the risks for animal and human health related to the presence of glycoalkaloids (GAs) in feed and food. This risk assessment covers edible parts of potato plants and other food plants containing GAs, in particular, tomato and aubergine. In humans, acute toxic effects of potato GAs (<U+03B1>-solanine and <U+03B1>-chaconine) include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. For these effects, the CONTAM Panel<U+00A0>identified a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level of 1 mg total potato GAs/kg body weight (bw) per day as a reference point for the risk characterisation following acute exposure. In humans, no evidence of health problems associated with repeated or long-term intake of GAs via potatoes has been identified. No reference point for chronic exposure could be identified from the experimental animal studies. Occurrence data were available only for <U+03B1>-solanine and <U+03B1>-chaconine, mostly for potatoes. The acute dietary exposure to potato GAs was estimated using a probabilistic approach and applying processing factors for food. Due to the limited data available, a margin of exposure (MOE) approach was applied. The MOEs for the younger age groups indicate a health concern for the food consumption surveys with the highest mean exposure, as well as for the P95 exposure in all surveys. For adult age groups, the MOEs indicate a health concern only for the food consumption surveys with the highest P95 exposures. For tomato and aubergine GAs, the risk to human health could not be characterised due to the lack of occurrence data and the limited toxicity data. For horses, farm and companion animals, no risk characterisation for potato GAs could be performed due to insufficient data on occurrence in feed and on potential adverse effects of GAs in these species.

[INST]  Extract all mentions of food from the text:   We examined whether the adherence to major dietary patterns at baseline of 5824 nondiabetic Danes (30-60 y) enrolled in the nonpharmacological Inter99 intervention predicted changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postchallenge 2-h plasma glucose (2h-PG) concentrations during a 5 y period and whether a potential association was dependent on baseline glucose tolerance status. Through principal component analysis, a score for a traditional dietary pattern (characterized by higher intakes of high-fat sandwich spreads, red meat, potatoes, butter and lard, low-fat fish, sandwich meat, and sauces) and a score for a modern dietary pattern (characterized by higher intakes of vegetables, fruit, vegetable oil/vinegar dressing, poultry, pasta, rice, and cereals) were estimated for each person at baseline. Random effect models adjusting for relevant confounders were used to estimate changes in repetitive measures of FPG and 2h-PG. A higher modern score (of 1 SD) predicted an annual decrease in 2h-PG of 0.015 mmol/L (P < 0.01) regardless of glucose tolerance status. For individuals with isolated impaired glucose tolerance, a higher traditional score (of 1 SD) predicted an annual increase in 2h-PG of 0.083 mmol/L (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, glucose tolerance status did not, in general, affect the predictive effect of the dietary patterns. The study suggests that the risk of worsening 2h-PG concentrations may be smaller for individuals with a high modern dietary pattern score characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit, vegetable oil/vinegar dressing, poultry, pasta, rice, and cereals.

[INST]  Extract all food entities present in the text:   Obesity is a major epidemic for developed countries in the 21st century. The main cause of obesity is energy imbalance, of which contributing factors include a sedentary lifestyle, epigenetic factors and excessive caloric intake through food and beverages. A high consumption of caloric beverages, such as alcoholic or sweetened drinks, may particularly contribute to weight gain, and lower satiety has been associated with the intake of liquid instead of solid calories. Our objective was to evaluate the association between the substitution of a serving per day of water for another beverage (or group of them) and the incidence of obesity and weight change in a Mediterranean cohort, using mathematical models. We followed 15,765 adults without obesity at baseline. The intake of 17 beverage items was assessed at baseline through a validated food-frequency questionnaire. The outcomes were average change in body weight in a four-year period and new-onset obesity and their association with the substitution of one serving per day of water for one of the other beverages. During the follow-up, 873 incident cases of obesity were identified. In substitution models, the consumption of water instead of beer or sugar-sweetened soda beverages was associated with a lower obesity incidence (the Odds Ratio (OR) 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.94) and OR 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.97); respectively) and, in the case of beer, it was also associated with a higher average weight loss (weight change difference = -328 g; (95% CI -566 to -89)). Thus, this study found that replacing one sugar-sweetened soda beverage or beer with one serving of water per day at baseline was related to a lower incidence of obesity and to a higher weight loss over a four-year period time in the case of beer, based on mathematical models.

[INST]  Identify all food items contained in the text:   The Mediterranean dietary pattern has been linked with reduced cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. Components of the Mediterranean diet associated with better cardiovascular health include low consumption of meat and meat products, moderate consumption of ethanol (mostly from wine), and high consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish, and olive oil. Increasing evidence indicates that the synergy among these components results in beneficial changes in intermediate pathways of cardiometabolic risk, such as lipids, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and vasoreactivity. As a result, consumption of a Mediterranean dietary pattern favorably affects numerous cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Moreover, strong evidence links this dietary pattern with reduced cardiovascular disease incidence, reoccurrence, and mortality. This review evaluates the current evidence behind the cardioprotective effects of a Mediterranean dietary pattern.

In addition a group of 45 female control workers matched by sex, age, and smoking habit were also studied. Intradermal skin testing with mixed spice dust allergen demonstrated positive skin reactions in 73.3% of exposed and in 33.3% of control workers (P less than 0.001). Increased IgE serum levels were found in 36.8% of exposed and in 9.7% of the control workers (P less than 0.01). The prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms was significantly higher in the exposed workers than in the control workers (P less than 0.01). There was, however, no consistent correlation between skin reactivity and chronic respiratory symptoms. There was a high prevalence of acute symptoms during the work shift. These complaints were more frequent in workers with positive skin tests for the symptoms of cough, chest tightness, and irritated and dry throat. Ventilatory capacity was measured by recording maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves. There were statistically significant mean reductions during the work shift for all measured lung function parameters in workers with positive skin reactions. In those workers with negative skin reactions only FEF50 and FEF25 reached statistical significance. Aqueous extracts of different spices (chilli pepper, paprika, caraway, coriander leaves, coriander seeds, cinnamon, ginger, onion, curry, and parsley) caused a dose-related contractile response of isolated guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle. These data suggest that immunologic reactions to spices are frequent in spice workers and may be related to acute symptoms and lung function changes, but not to chronic changes. The data further suggest that, in addition to any immunologic response these spices may produce in vivo, they probably also provoke direct irritant reactions in the airways as suggested by in vitro data.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Pulses, including peas, are a good source of protein, dietary fiber, folic acid, and iron and are reported to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, pulse ingredients present a known challenge as they exhibit a grassy/beany off-flavor. Heat treatment in some cases can decrease this off-flavor. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of substitution of 20% split yellow pea (SYP) flour treated by Revtech thermal processing at 140<U+00A0><U+00B0>C with 10% steam (RT10%) and without steam (RT0%) for wheat flour in bread on the sensory attributes, acceptability, nutrient composition, firmness, color, and pH. RT10% was more acceptable overall than bread with untreated pea flour (USYP) or RT0% as assessed by 110 consumers. Sensory attributes were defined and measured on 15-cm line scales by an 11 member trained panel. Attributes associated with RT10% included wheaty, sweet, and yeast aromas and wheaty flavor, whereas attributes associated with USYP and RT0% were pea and nutty aroma and flavor. Although firmness and dryness were higher in RT10%, the acceptability of the bread texture was not affected. This sample contained significantly higher protein and lower carbohydrate than the wheat sample. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Revtech (RT), a novel thermal process, when applied at 140<U+00A0><U+00B0>C with steam to split yellow pea (SYP) flour successfully increased the acceptability of white pan bread fortified at 20% compared to bread fortified with RT 140<U+00A0><U+00B0>C with no steam, and untreated SYP flours. This could be due to its association with wheaty aroma and flavor attributes rather than the pea aroma and flavor attributes of the other two breads.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms contained in the text:   Sodium can be found in many sources of the US diet. Dietary guidelines currently suggest a maximum intake of 2,300 mg of sodium (6g of sodium chloride) per day, whereas the average consumer intake is 3,600 mg of sodium (9 g of sodium chloride) per day. The main health concern with high consumption of sodium is hypertension. The objectives of this study were to identify the salty taste intensity of sodium chloride in water and various dairy food matrices, and to identify the just-noticeable difference in concentration at which consumers noticed a decrease in salty taste in these food products. Solutions and food products (water, cheese sauce, cottage cheese, and milk-based soup) were prepared with sodium chloride ranging in concentration from 0.008 to 0.06 M. Seventeen panelists evaluated the salty intensity of each product in triplicate using a magnitude estimation scale. In subsequent tests, panelists (n=50) evaluated salty intensity of these food products in separate sessions using an ascending force choice method to determine the just-noticeable difference. Consumer acceptance tests (n=75 consumers) were conducted with cottage cheeses with and without sodium reductions and under conditions with and without health benefits of sodium reduction. The magnitude estimation scale data were log-transformed, and all data were analyzed by ANOVA with Fisher's least significant difference for means separation. The linear proportion of the power function in the salty taste intensity curve for sodium chloride solutions and the 3 foods was between 0.03 and 0.20 M. Consumers were able to notice and correctly identify reductions in salt concentration of less than 20% in all products. When consumers were informed of sodium reduction and its health benefits before tasting cottage cheese with lower sodium (4-12%), overall liking scores for the lower sodium cottage cheeses were not different from higher sodium cottage cheeses. These results suggest that reducing sodium in cheese sauce, cottage cheese, and milk-based soups may be challenging and that exploration of sodium chloride alternatives in these foods is warranted. Appropriate product positioning or advertising may be beneficial to consumer acceptance of lower sodium types of products.

We based our work on an expert meeting conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2003. A qualitative reading and evaluation of relevant articles on the cancer-preventive effect of the consumption of fruits and vegetables was made followed by the calculation of the mean relative risk and range for cohort and case-control studies separately. The possible population-preventable fraction for modifying diet in relation to fruit and vegetable consumption was calculated as well as an overall statement about the degree of evidence for the cancer-preventive effect of fruit and vegetable consumption for each cancer site. There is limited evidence for a cancer-preventive effect of the consumption of fruits and vegetables for cancer of the mouth and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon-rectum, larynx, lung, ovary (vegetables only), bladder (fruit only), and kidney. There is inadequate evidence for a cancer-preventive effect of the consumption of fruits and vegetables for all other sites. Applying this range of risk difference to the range of prevalence of low intake, the preventable fraction for low fruit and vegetable intake would fall into the range of 5-12%. It is important to recognize that this is only a crude range of estimates and that the proportion of cancers that might be preventable by increasing fruit and vegetable intake may vary beyond this range for specific cancer sites and across different regions of the world.

The prevalence of hypersensitivity to wheat and soy appears similar to sesame seed, cashew nut, hazelnut and walnut, but allergy to fish, brazil nut and shell fish are uncommon. Despite a different methodology, reports from several Asian centres suggest a similar frequency of hypersensitivity to these foods in young children although hypersensitivity to shellfish and seafood was more common than for nuts, peanut and wheat, if seafoods are part of the staple infant diet.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Milk consumption decreases inflammatory stress in overweight and obese subjects. Casein is the major protein in milk and enhances the secretion of insulin that has anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of the present study was to compare the acute effect of meals rich in casein and carbohydrate and a combination of both nutrients on postprandial plasma concentrations of IL-6, a marker of inflammation, in obese women. A total of twenty-five obese women aged 38-68 years consumed isoenergetic meals rich in potato (POT) or casein (CA) or a combination of both these meals (POT<U+00A0>+<U+00A0>CA), in random order in a cross-over trial. After an overnight fast, blood samples were collected before and at 1 and 4<U+00A0>h after the meals and circulating concentrations of IL-6, glucose, insulin and NEFA were measured. Plasma IL-6 concentrations increased significantly (P<U+00A0><<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>001) during 4<U+00A0>h after the meals. The AUC of postprandial IL-6 concentrations was not significantly (P<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>77) different among the meals. Postprandial serum insulin concentration AUC was significantly higher during the POT<U+00A0>+<U+00A0>CA meal compared with the POT meal (P<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>001) and the CA meal (P<U+00A0><<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>05), which in turn was significantly higher than the POT meal (P<U+00A0><<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>05). These data show that while ingestion of CA alone or combined with POT acutely increases circulating insulin concentrations, it does not appreciably alter the postprandial increase in plasma IL-6 concentrations in obese women.

[INST]  Identify all food entities mentioned in the text:   Coeliac disease (CD) affects about 1<U+00A0>% of the general population. Information concerning gluten intake in the general population is scarce. In particular, variation in gluten intake during the complementary feeding period may be an independent risk factor in CD pathogenesis. We determined the intake of gluten from wheat, barley, rye and oats in a cross-sectional National Danish Survey of Dietary Habits among Infants and Young Children (2006-2007). The study population comprised a random sample of 1743 children aged 6-36 months, recruited from the National Danish Civil Registry. The protein contents from wheat, rye, barley and oats were found in the National Danish Food Composition Table, and multiplied with the amounts in the recipes. The amounts of gluten were calculated as the amount of cereal protein<U+00A0><U+00D7><U+00A0>0<U+00B7>80 for wheat and oats, <U+00D7>0<U+00B7>65 for rye and <U+00D7>0<U+00B7>50 for barley. Dietary intake was recorded daily for seven consecutive days in pre-coded food records supplemented with open-answer possibilities. Gluten intake increased with age (P<U+00A0><<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>0001). Oats were introduced first, rapidly outpaced by wheat, the intake of which continued to increase with age, whereas oats started to decrease at 12 months. Boys had a higher intake of energy (P<U+00A0><U+2264><U+00A0>0<U+00B7>0001) and all types of gluten, except for barley (P<U+00A0><U+2264><U+00A0>0<U+00B7>87). In 8-10-month-old (P<U+00A0><<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>0001) and 10-12-month-old (P<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>007), but not in 6-8-month-old infants (P<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0<U+00B7>331), non-breast-fed infants had higher total gluten intake than partially breast-fed infants. In conclusion, this study presents representative population-based data on gluten intake in Danish infants and young children.

Their common structural features, such as eight conserved cysteines forming disulfide bridges, basic isoelectric point and high similarity in amino acid sequence, are the basis of allergic clinical cross-reactivity. This has been demonstrated for the LTP allergens of the Prunoideae subfamily, whose similarity is about 95% as demonstrated for the purified allergens of peach, apricot, plum and apple. A relevant aspect is the existence of sequence homology of LTPs of botanically unrelated foods, as demonstrated for LTPs of maize and peach. A class of food allergens of well recognized clinical importance is that of seed storage 2S albumins. They have been identified in the most diffused edible seeds and nuts, such as mustard, sesame, Brazil nut, walnut and peanut.

Per capita consumer exposure to most of these food ingredients is rather low with a few notable exceptions such as sugar and starch. Some food ingredients including edible oils, hydrolyzed proteins, lecithin, starch, lactose, flavors and gelatin may, at least in some products, be derived from sources commonly involved in IgE-mediated food allergies. These ingredients should be avoided by consumers with allergies to the source material if the ingredient contains detectable protein residues. Other food ingredients, including starch, malt, alcohol and vinegar, may be derived in some cases from wheat, rye or barley, the grains that are implicated in the causation of celiac disease. If these ingredients contain gluten residues, then they should be avoided by celiac sufferers. A few food ingredients are capable of eliciting allergic sensitization, although these ingredients would be classified as rarely allergenic. These ingredients include carmine, cochineal extract, annatto, tragacanth gum and papain.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items listed in the text:   A large clinical/serologic study was carried out to determine the prevalence of Apiaceae (carrot, celery, and fennel) hypersensitivity in patients with birch pollen allergy, and to investigate its relationship with apple and hazelnut allergy and with birch pollen-specific IgE levels. A total of 196 birch pollen-hypersensitive patients with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) caused by different vegetable foods were examined in the cross-sectional part of the study. Of this total, 195 patients had apple and/or hazelnut allergy, and 103 had Apiaceae sensitivity; only one patient had Apiaceae allergy alone. Apiaceae-positive patients showed significantly higher birch pollen-specific IgE levels than negative ones (median 13 vs 7 AU/ml; P < 0.0001). The prospective part of the study was performed on 103 birch pollen-hypersensitive patients who were OAS-free at the time of the first visit and were periodically followed-up for OAS. Patients who developed Apiaceae sensitivity showed much higher birch-specific IgE levels than patients who developed apple/hazelnut allergy only (median 15.5 vs 8.5 AU/ml; P < 0.05), whereas those who remained OAS-free showed the lowest specific IgE levels (median 5 AU/ml). This study suggests that most Apiaceae determinants cross-react with apple or hazelnut determinants, whereas only some apple or hazelnut determinants cross-react with Apiaceae-allergenic determinants; moreover, it shows that birch-specific IgE levels heavily influence the onset of OAS as a whole, and probably play a critical role in the development of allergies to distinct vegetable foods as well.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   The liver is a "front line" in the homeostatic defenses against variation in nutrient intake. It orchestrates metabolic responses to feeding by secreting factors essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, converting carbohydrates to triglycerides for storage, and releasing lipids packaged as lipoproteins for distribution to other tissues. Between meals, it provides fuel to the body by releasing glucose produced from glucogenic precursors and ketones from fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids. Modern diets enriched in sugars and saturated fats increase lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). If untreated, this can progress to liver inflammation (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Dysregulation of liver metabolism is also relatively common in modern societies. Increased hepatic glucose production underlies fasting hyperglycemia that defines type 2 diabetes, while increased production of atherogenic, large, triglyceride-rich, very low-density lipoproteins raises the risk of cardiovascular disease. Evidence has accrued of a strong connection between meal timing, the liver clock, and metabolic homeostasis. Metabolic programming of the liver transcriptome and posttranslation modifications of proteins is strongly influenced by the daily rhythms in nutrient intake governed by the circadian clock. Importantly, whereas cell-autonomous clocks have been identified in the liver, the complete circadian programing of the liver transcriptome and posttranslational modifications of essential metabolic proteins is strongly dependent on nutrient flux and circadian signals from outside the liver. The purpose of this review is to provide a basic understanding of liver circadian physiology, drawing attention to recent research on the relationships between circadian biology and liver function.

Few studies, however, have examined these factors in relation to occurrence of colorectal polyps. The authors used case-control data from 488 matched pairs to evaluate associations of vegetables, fruits, and grains with polyps. Subjects were southern Californians aged 50-74 years who had a sigmoidoscopy in 1991-1993. Diet in the year before sigmoidoscopy was measured with a food frequency questionnaire. Frequent consumption of vegetables, fruits, and grains was associated with decreased polyp prevalence. Specifically, the adjusted odds ratio comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of intake for vegetables was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.76), for fruits was 0.65 (95% CI 0.40-1.05), and for grains was 0.55 (95% CI 0.33-0.91). The authors also found inverse associations for high carotenoid vegetables, cruciferae, high vitamin C fruits, garlic, and tofu (or soybeans). After further adjusting for potentially anticarcinogenic constituents of these foods, high carotenoid vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, garlic, and tofu (or soybeans) remained inversely associated with polyps. These findings support the hypothesis that high intake of vegetables, fruits, or grains decreases the risk of polyps and suggest that any protective effects might reflect unmeasured constituents in these foods.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms found in the text:   Our objective was to identify and describe the major dietary patterns in the Mexican adult population and their association with being overweight or obese. Dietary intake was evaluated by a FFQ that was completed by 15,890 Mexican adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2006. Dietary patterns were generated by cluster analysis based on the percent contribution to total energy intake from 30 food groups. We identified 3 major dietary patterns: refined foods and sweets (RS), traditional (T), and diverse (D). The T pattern was characterized by low dietary diversity, with maize and maize foods accounting for ~47% of energy intake. This pattern had the lowest contribution of most food groups, with the exception of beans (~4.0%). The RS pattern had the highest contribution of alcohol (9.4%), soft drinks (9.4%), white bread (7.7%), fast food, sweets, and snacks. The D pattern had the lowest contribution of maize (15.5%) and the highest contribution of whole-fat dairy (8.0%), rice and pasta, meat, poultry, eggs, saturated fat, fruits, and vegetables. After adjusting for age, gender, physical activity, socioeconomic status, area, and region, the RS and D dietary patterns were associated with 14 and 17% increased risk of being overweight (P < 0.01) and 20% increased risk of being obese, respectively, compared with the T dietary pattern (P < 0.001). These findings support an association of dietary patterns with being overweight or obese in a nationally representative sample of Mexican adults.

[INST]  Identify all food-related entities present in the text:   Postprandial plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations are predictive of relative cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and the pathogenesis of both insulin resistance and atherosclerosis has been attributed to acute states of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Postprandial lipemia and hyperglycemia suppress vascular reactivity and induce endothelial dysfunction. Epidemiological studies suggest that chronically-high consumption of milk and milk products is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and CVD. The addition of dairy products to meals high in carbohydrates and fat may lessen these risks through reductions in postprandial glucose and triglyceride responses. Purported mechanisms include dairy proteins and bioactive compounds, which may explain the inverse relationship between dairy consumption and cardiometabolic diseases. The current review evaluates the available literature describing the relationships between metabolic dysfunction, postprandial metabolism, and vascular dysfunction and discusses the potential role of milk and dairy products in attenuating these impairments.

[INST]  Find all mentions of food entities in the text:   The effect of coffee total lipids (CTL), coffee non-saponifiable matter (NSM) and coffee diterpene alcohols (DTA) extracted from Coffea arabica beans on serum cholesterol in adult male Syrian hamsters was examined. The animals were fed either a commercial laboratory chow diet (study 1), containing 5% fat and low in saturated fat (1.46 g/100 g diet) and cholesterol (0.03 g/100 g diet) or a semi-synthetic diet (study 2) set in gelatine, containing 10% fat and high in saturated fat (4 g/100 g diet) and cholesterol (0.5 g/100 g diet). The coffee lipid extracts were dissolved in olive oil (concentration either 5 mg CTL, 0.5 mg NSM or 0.5 mg DTA per 250 microliters olive oil) in study 1 and in coconut oil (concentration either 20 mg CTL, 2 mg NSM or 2 mg DTA per 250 microliters) in study 2. A dose of 250 microliters of these solutions was administered daily to hamsters by gavage. Control animals received 250 microliters vehicle only. For serum lipid analysis, blood samples were obtained on days 0, 7 and 14 in study 1 and on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 in study 2. Statistical analyses of the data in Study 1 indicated a tendency for serum total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol to increase with administration of CTL, NSM and DTA. In contrast, in study 2 there were no significant differences in serum lipid levels between control and coffee lipid-treated groups across time. In either study, total serum cholesterol levels of the three coffee lipid groups were not significantly different from each other. These results support the concept that coffee lipids may be hypercholesterolaemic and indicate that diterpenes could be the lipid component responsible for such an effect. However, it appears that this hypercholesterolaemic effect is apparent only when the background diet is low in saturated fat and cholesterol. A high saturated fat/high cholesterol diet may mask the hypercholesterolaemic effect of coffee lipids.

We previously demonstrated that high-lard diet induces intestinal metaplasia, a precancerous lesion of the stomach mediated by leptin signaling. This study aims to investigate which kinds of dietary fat cause the intestinal metaplasia onset. We fed eight kinds of high-fat diets (HFDs) of animal or plant origin to mice evaluated their effect on gastric pathogenesis. Five types of dietary fat were divided according to their observed effects: Obese with high metaplasia (group I; beef tallow, lard, and hydrogenated coconut oil), non-obese with high metaplasia (group II; linseed oil), obese without metaplasia (group III; corn oil and olive oil), non-obese without metaplasia (group IV, soybean oil) and lean without metaplasia (group V; cocoa butter). The group I and II diets induced leptin, phosphorylated leptin receptor (ObR), signal transducer and activator 3 (STAT3), and increased intracellular <U+03B2>-catenin accumulation in the stomach.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms mentioned in the text:   A growing interest has emerged in the beneficial effects of plant-based diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. The Mediterranean diet, one of the most widely evaluated dietary patterns in scientific literature, includes in its nutrients two fluid foods: olive oil, as the main source of fats, and a low-to-moderate consumption of wine, mainly red, particularly during meals. Current mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet include a reduction in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, improvement in lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, as well as antithrombotic properties. Most of these effects are attributable to bioactive ingredients including polyphenols, mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Polyphenols are a heterogeneous group of phytochemicals containing phenol rings. The principal classes of red wine polyphenols include flavonols (quercetin and myricetin), flavanols (catechin and epicatechin), anthocyanin and stilbenes (resveratrol). Olive oil has at least 30 phenolic compounds. Among them, the main are simple phenols (tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol), secoroids and lignans.

[INST]  Identify all food-related entities present in the text:   Potatoes have been an affordable, staple part of the diet for many hundreds of years. Recently however, there has been a decline in consumption, perhaps influenced by erroneous reports of being an unhealthy food. This review provides an overview of the nutritional value of potatoes and examines the evidence for associations between potato consumption and non-communicable diseases. Potatoes are an important source of micronutrients, such as vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium, folate, and iron and contribute a significant amount of fibre to the diet. However, nutrient content is affected by cooking method; boiling causes leaching of water-soluble nutrients, whereas frying can increase the resistant starch content of the cooked potato. Epidemiological studies have reported associations between potato intake and obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, results are contradictory and confounded by lack of detail on cooking methods. Indeed, potatoes have been reported to be more satiating than other starchy carbohydrates, such as pasta and rice, which may aid weight maintenance. Future research should consider cooking methods in the study design in order to reduce confounding factors and further explore the health impact of this food.

[INST]  Locate all mentions of food in the text:   Night-workers, transcontinental travelers and individuals that regularly shift their sleep timing, suffer from circadian desynchrony and are at risk to develop metabolic disease, cancer, and mood disorders, among others. Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that food intake restricted to the normal activity phase is a potent synchronizer for the circadian system and can prevent the detrimental metabolic effects associated with circadian disruption. As an alternative, we hypothesized that a timed piece of chocolate scheduled to the onset of the activity phase may be sufficient stimulus to synchronize circadian rhythms under conditions of shift-work or jet-lag. In Wistar rats, a daily piece of chocolate coupled to the onset of the active phase (breakfast) accelerated re-entrainment in a jet-lag model by setting the activity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the new cycle. Furthermore, in a rat model of shift-work, a piece of chocolate for breakfast prevented circadian desynchrony, by increasing the amplitude of the day-night c-Fos activation in the SCN. Contrasting, chocolate for dinner prevented re-entrainment in the jet-lag condition and favored circadian desynchrony in the shift-work models. Moreover, chocolate for breakfast resulted in low body weight gain while chocolate for dinner boosted up body weight. Present data evidence the relevance of the timing of a highly caloric and palatable meal for circadian synchrony and metabolic function.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   Beer is the most widely consumed alcoholic drink in the world, but it is not suitable for patients who suffer from celiac disease (CD) because its main ingresdients, barley or wheat, contain gluten. Approximately 1% of the world's population is affected by CD, and the development of gluten-free beer is imperative. Gluten-free beers produced using alternative materials, such as rice, sorghum, maize, millet, oats, and pseudocereals (e.g., buckwheat, quinoa and Amaranth), are studied in this review that examines the effects of specific substitutions on the different characteristics of the final beer to ensure the appropriateness of their use. The use of alternatives to malt may affect the quality of gluten-free beer and result in some negative consequences. Accordingly, the influential factors are discussed in terms of the total substitution of malt with other grains in the production of beer. Research results have provided some new alternative solutions for the production of gluten-free beer, such as the use of malted grains to improve hydrolytic enzyme activity, the application of nonconventional mashing procedures involving the decoction method and extrusion cooking techniques to increase the extract yield, the use of exogenous enzymes and nitrogen supplements to improve the sugar and amino acid spectra necessary for yeast fermentation, and the application of combinations of alternative grains to improve the flavor, body and foam stability of gluten-free beers.

As of 1991-1992 in Seoul, the cumulative rates reported for the age span 0-74 were 7.6% in males and 3.1% in females. A recent case-control study reported that several food items and cooking methods are associated with increased or decreased risk of stomach cancer among Koreans. An increased risk of stomach cancer was noted among people who frequently consume broiled meats and fishes, salted side dishes (salted/fermented fish products) and salty stewed foods, such as soybean paste thick stew. Frequent consumption of mung bean pancake, tofu, cabbage, spinach and sesame oil decreased the risk. Analysis by cooking method showed that risk of stomach cancer from the same foods varied with preparation. For meat and fish, pan frying was associated with decreased risk, whereas stewing or broiling was associated with increased risk. Pickled vegetables increased the risk, whereas fresh vegetables did not. In a recent cohort study in Seoul, green vegetables and soybean foods were associated with a decreased risk of stomach cancer.

Four hundred thirty two bladder cancer cases and 392 frequency matched hospital-based controls recruited in the South and East of China between October 2005 and June 2008 were interviewed on their intake of 6 nonalcoholic and 3 alcoholic drinks. Age, sex, smoking and hospital-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all drinks and for total fluid intake using logistic regression. For 381 cases (81.9% men) and 371 controls (76.3% men), total fluid intake could be calculated. In men, an increase in total fluid intake was associated with a significantly decreased bladder cancer risk (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99, per cup fluid consumed). Neither green nor black tea consumption was associated with bladder cancer. Daily consumption of milk significantly reduced the risk of bladder cancer by a half (OR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32-0.76), which strengthens earlier suggestions that milk is probably associated with a decreased bladder cancer risk. Consumption of wine (OR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34-0.70) and liquor/spirits (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.92) were associated with a significantly reduced risk.

Uncontrolled high blood pressure may lead to a shortened life expectancy and a higher morbidity due to a high risk of cardiovascular complications such as coronary heart disease (which leads to heart attack) and stroke, congestive heart failure, heart rhythm irregularities, and kidney failure etc. In recent years, it has been recognized that many dietary constituents may contribute to human cardiovascular health. There has been an increased focus on identifying these natural components of foods, describing their physiological activities and mechanisms of actions. Grain, vegetables, fruits, milk, cheese, meat, chicken, egg, fish, soybean, tea, wine, mushrooms, and lactic acid bacteria are various food sources with potential antihypertensive effects. Their main bioactive constituents include angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides, vitamins C and E, flavonoids, flavanols, cathecins, anthocyanins, phenolic acids, polyphenols, tannins, resveratrol, polysaccharides, fiber, saponin, sterols, as well as K, Ca, and P. They may reduce blood pressure by different mechanisms, such as ACE inhibition effect, antioxidant, vasodilatory, opiate-like, Ca(2+) channel blocking, and chymase inhibitory activities. These functional foods may provide new therapeutic applications for hypertension prevention and treatment, and contribute to a healthy cardiovascular population.

After the discovery of America, chocolate was introduced in Europe, but Christian Europe looked to this new exhilarating drink with extreme suspiciousness and criticism. From this reaction, the necessity derived to appeal to the reasons of health, with which doctors and scientists committed themselves to explain that chocolate was good for the body. However, during the Enlightment, the road of therapy separated from that of taste, and chocolate mainly maintained its leading role of excipient, bearing the burden, over time, of a negative valence, being associated with obesity, dental problems, unhealthy lifestyle, and so forth. The rehabilitation of chocolate has arisen only in recent times, re-establishing that value that Linnaeus himself credited to chocolate, calling the generous plant Theobroma cacao, food of the gods.

To further elucidate the role of dietary habits, 1,225 subjects with cancer of the colon, 728 with cancer of the rectum and 4,154 controls, hospitalized with acute non-neoplastic diseases, were interviewed between 1992 and 1996 in 6 different Italian areas. The validated food-frequency questionnaire included 79 questions on food items and recipes, categorised into 16 food groups. After allowance for non-dietary confounding factors and total energy intake, significant trends of increasing risk of colorectal cancer with increasing intake emerged for bread and cereal dishes (odds ratio [OR] in highest vs. lowest quintile = 1.7), potatoes (OR = 1.2), cakes and desserts (OR = 1.1), and refined sugar (OR = 1.4). Intakes of fish (OR = 0.7), raw and cooked vegetables (OR = 0.6 for both) and fruit other than citrus fruit (OR = 0.7) showed a negative association with risk. Consumption of eggs and meat (white, red or processed meats) seemed uninfluential. Most findings were similar for colon and rectum, but some negative associations (i.e., coffee and tea, and fish) appeared stronger for colon cancer. Our findings lead us to reconsider the role of starchy foods and refined sugar in light of recent knowledge on the digestive physiology of carbohydrates and the insulin/colon cancer hypothesis. The beneficial role of most vegetables is confirmed, with more than 20% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer from the addition of one daily serving.

Many studies have shown therapeutic effects of cinnamon including its antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, antioxidant, antitumor, antihypertensive, antilipemic, antidiabetic, gastroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. Due to popular use of cinnamon and several human reports on adverse events associated with short or long term use of cinnamon, we aimed to systematically review its human reports of adverse event. Databases including Medline, Scopus, Science Direct, Embase, PubMed Central and Google scholar were searched using the key words "cinnamon" or "cinnamomum" for clinical trials, case reports and case series. Also spontaneous reports about adverse effects of cinnamon were collected from five national and international spontaneous reporting schemes. Thirty eight clinical trials were found, five of them reported adverse events. Twenty case reports and seven case series, as well as, spontaneous reports including 160 adverse events were also included. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders and allergic reactions which were self-limiting in the majority of cases. The available data suggests that despite the safety of cinnamon use as a spice and/or flavoring agent, its use may be associated with significant adverse effects in medicinal uses with larger doses or longer duration of use and should be clinically monitored.

[INST]  Retrieve all food entities mentioned in the text:   Biogenic amines have been reported in a variety of foods, such as fish, meat, cheese, vegetables, and wines. They are described as low molecular weight organic bases with aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic structures. The most common biogenic amines found in foods are histamine, tyramine, cadaverine, 2-phenylethylamine, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, tryptamine, and agmatine. In addition octopamine and dopamine have been found in meat and meat products and fish. The formation of biogenic amines in food by the microbial decarboxylation of amino acids can result in consumers suffering allergic reactions, characterized by difficulty in breathing, itching, rash, vomiting, fever, and hypertension. Traditionally, biogenic amine formation in food has been prevented, primarily by limiting microbial growth through chilling and freezing. However, for many fishing based subsistence populations, such measures are not practical. Therefore, secondary control measures to prevent biogenic amine formation in foods or to reduce their levels once formed need to be considered as alternatives. Such approaches to limit microbial growth may include hydrostatic pressures, irradiation, controlled atmosphere packaging, or the use of food additives. Histamine may potentially be degraded by the use of bacterial amine oxidase or amine-negative bacteria. Only some will be cost-effective and practical for use in subsistence populations.

Biological activities associated with mango fractions were assessed in cell-based assays to develop effective extraction and fractionation methodologies and to define sources of variability. Two techniques were developed for extraction and fractionation of mango fruit peel and flesh. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to assess compositional differences between mango fractions in flesh extracts. Many of the extracts were effective in inhibiting the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. All fractions showed bioactivity in PPAR activation assays, but quantitative responses showed marked fruit-to-fruit variability, highlighting the need to bulk fruit prior to extraction for activity-guided fractionation of bioactive components. This study also suggests that combinations of diverse molecular components may be responsible for cell-level bioactivities from mango fractions, and that purification and activity profiling of individual components may be difficult to relate to whole fruit effects. Practical Application: Although the health benefits of fruits are strongly indicated from studies of diet and disease, it is not known what role individual fruit types can play, particularly for tropical fruits. This study shows that there is a diversity of potentially beneficial bioactivities within the flesh and peel of mango fruit, although fruit-to-fruit variation can be large. The results add to the evidence that the food approach of eating all components of fruits is likely to be more beneficial to health than consuming refined extracts, as the purification process would inevitably remove components with beneficial bioactivities.

Because PPAR agonists have the potential to prevent or ameliorate diseases such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and obesity, we have explored new natural agonists for PPAR. For this purpose, cow's milk was tested for agonistic activity toward human PPAR subtypes using a reporter gene assay. Milk increased human PPARalpha activity in a dose-dependent manner with a 3.2-fold increase at 0.5% (vol/vol). It also enhanced human PPARdelta activity in a dose-dependent manner with an 11.5-fold increase at 0.5%. However, it only slightly affected human PPARgamma activity. Ice cream, butter, and yogurt also increased the activities of PPARalpha and PPARdelta, whereas vegetable cream affected activity of PPARdelta but not PPARalpha. Skim milk enhanced the activity of PPAR to a lesser degree than regular milk. Milk and fresh cream increased the activity of human retinoid X receptor (RXR)alpha as well as PPARalpha and PPARdelta, whereas neither affected vitamin D3 receptor, estrogen receptors alpha and beta, or thyroid receptors alpha and beta. Both milk and fresh cream were shown by quantitative real-time PCR to increase the quantity of mRNA for uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), an energy expenditure gene, in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in UCP2 mRNA was found to be reduced by treatment with PPARdelta-short interfering (si)RNA. This study unambiguously clarified at the cellular level that cow's milk increased the activities of human PPARalpha, PPARdelta, and RXRalpha. The possible role in enhancing the activities of PPARalpha, PPARdelta, and RXRalpha, and the health benefits of cow's milk were discussed.

The objective of this study was to examine most important quality parameters of vacuum (1.92 inHg) and atmospheric-fried carrot, potato, and apple slices to determine specific advantages of vacuum technology. Slices were fried using equivalent thermal driving forces, maintaining a constant difference between oil temperature and the boiling point of water at the working pressure (<U+0394>T = 60 and 80 <U+00B0>C). This resulted in frying temperatures of 160 and 180 <U+00B0>C, and 98 and 118 <U+00B0>C, for atmospheric and vacuum frying, respectively. Vacuum-fried carrot and potato chips absorbed about 50% less oil than atmospheric-fried chips, whereas vacuum-fried apple chips reduced oil absorption by 25%. Total carotenoids and ascorbic acid (AA) were greatly preserved during vacuum frying. Carrot chips vacuum fried at 98 <U+00B0>C retained about 90% of total carotenoids, whereas potato and apple slices vacuum fried at 98 <U+00B0>C, preserved around 95% of their initial AA content. Interestingly, results showed that the antioxidant capacity of chips may be related to both the presence of natural antioxidants and brown pigments developed at elevated temperatures.

To test this hypothesis, rabbits were fed for 30 days diets containing 2 g corn oil/100 g diet (low fat diet) or low fat supplemented with 16 g/100 g diet of corn oil, corn oil with added cholesterol, milk fat, chicken fat, beef tallow or lard. Compared with those fed the low fat, serum and LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower in rabbits fed corn oil and greater in animals fed corn oil with added cholesterol or chicken fat. In contrast to the cholesterol data, lipid hydroperoxide levels were highest in oxidized LDL derived from rabbits fed corn oil or lard. LDL vitamin E levels were highest in rabbits fed corn oil with added cholesterol. The significant elevations in linoleic acid [18:2(n-6)] in serum and LDL may partially explain the high oxidizability of LDL in rabbits fed corn oil. LDL isolated from animals fed corn oil, lard or milk fat had significantly greater albumin transfer across cultured endothelial monolayers compared with those of the low fat diet group. Their oxidative modification further contributed to endothelial barrier dysfunction. Dietary cholesterol supplementation to the corn oil diet decreased oxidizability of LDL and partially protected the oxidized LDL-mediated endothelial cell dysfunction as compared with the corn oil diet group. These data suggest that beef tallow and chicken fat are the least atherogenic fats if oxidative modification of LDL is a critical issue in atherosclerosis.

The Copenhagen Prospective Population Studies demonstrated in the year 2000 that wine intake may have a beneficial effect on all cause mortality that is additive to that of alcohol. Wine contains various poliphenolic substances which may be beneficial for health and in particular flavonols (such as myricetin and quercetin), catechin and epicatechin, proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, various phenolic acids and the stilbene resveratrol. In particular, resveratrol seems to play a positive effect on longevity because it increases the expression level of Sirt1, besides its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties. Moderate wine drinking is part of the Mediterranean diet, together with abundant and variable plant foods, high consumption of cereals, olive oil as the main (added) fat and a low intake of (red) meat. This healthy diet pattern involves a "Mediterranean way of drinking," that is a regular, moderate wine consumption mainly with food (up to two glasses a day for men and one glass for women). Moderate wine drinking increases longevity, reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and does not appreciably influence the overall risk of cancer.

Yogurt intake has received special attention because its association with health benefits is more consistent than that of other types of dairy products. In the present article, we review those observational studies that evaluated the association between yogurt consumption and type 2 diabetes. We also discuss the possible mechanisms involved in these associations. We found that 13 prospective studies evaluated the association between yogurt intake and type 2 diabetes, most of which showed an inverse association between the frequency of yogurt consumption and the risk of diabetes. In addition to the scientific evidence accumulated from individual prospective studies, several meta-analyses have shown that yogurt consumption has a potential role in diabetes prevention. The most recent analysis shows a 14% lower risk of type 2 diabetes when yogurt consumption was 80-125 g/d compared with no yogurt consumption. The intake of fermented dairy products, especially yogurt, has been inversely associated with variables of glucose metabolism. Yogurt may have probiotic effects that could modulate glucose metabolism. We conclude that yogurt consumption, in the context of a healthy dietary pattern, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in healthy and older adults at high cardiovascular risk. Large-scale intervention studies and randomized clinical trials are warranted to determine if yogurt consumption has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.

[INST]  Extract all food items mentioned in the text:   Changes in our understanding of diet and health drive changes in the way foods are processed. Conversely, what is available on the shelf will have an impact on the choices consumers make, thereby affecting their health. Historical examples of industrial manipulation of the diet include fortification and enrichment of cereal grains with vitamins; increased production of unsaturated vegetable oils and margarine as substitutions for hydrogenated fat, lard, and butter; lowered cholesterol content foods; reduced sugar content foods; lower sodium foods; decreased portion sizes or caloric density in prepackaged foods for use in weight loss or maintenance; and increased calcium levels to prevent osteoporosis. However, degenerative diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, bone disease, arthritis, and dementia will continue to be prevalent in the future. Whether or not the food systems available on the shelf can influence all of these disease states is not clear; however, studies have indicated that nutritional factors do contribute to the development of some of these diseases. Patterns in food consumption have changed and will continue to change as recommendations such as decreased consumption of saturated fats, salt, and cholesterol continue to be made. Increased ingestion of fish and/or fish oil is one recommendation that has been suggested because of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on platelet aggregability and circulating levels of lipids. Wildly speculating from preliminary studies, fish oil has also been recommended for disease states including arthritis, cancer, and diseases of the immune system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  [/INST] Certainly, the entities connected with food are detailed below:  cereal grains, unsaturated vegetable oils, margarine, fat, lard, butter, lowered cholesterol content foods, reduced sugar content foods, lower sodium foods, salt, fish, fish oil.

[INST]  Find all food entities present in the text:   Tofu, made by coagulating soy milk, is a nutritious food originating in China and is widely consumed globally. Due to allergenicity and consumer perceptions of genetically modified organisms, consumer demand for soy alternatives is increasing. In this study, tofu was made from yellow split peas (Pisum sativum). Effects of pasteurization, fat addition, and curd disruption followed by repressing were studied. Here, disruption was not a chemical disruption, rather a physical disruption of protein curds. Pasteurization alone led to increased uptake of water and nonviable tofus. Disrupted samples became firmer with pasteurization. Texture profile analysis indicated that disruption followed by pasteurization improved hardness from approximately 175<U+00A0>g force from the control, to approximately 325<U+00A0>g force for disrupted + pasteurizated samples without fat addition. A similar trend was observed for samples with fat added, where hardness increased from approximately 50<U+00A0>g force to approximately 75<U+00A0>g force. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of the amide I region showed that an increase of <U+03B2>-sheet structures led to increased hardness. The shifts in <U+03B2>-sheet structures followed the same trends as surface hydrophobicity. Surface hydrophobicity decreased with pasteurization and increased with disruption. Molecular weight analysis showed that shear (from disruption) and heat separately degraded the proteins into smaller polypeptides exposing hydrophobic interiors. Changes to biochemical parameters, such as protein secondary structure and exposure of protein hydrophobic regions, allowed for tofu to be made from yellow field peas.

Osteoporosis affects a large proportion of the elderly population worldwide and the incidence is increasing. Milk consumption is an accepted strategy in building peak bone mass and therefore may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. In childhood calcium, phosphorous, and growth factors are the important components to support bone growth but in adults the positive influence on bone density/maintenance may also be due to other bioactive proteins/peptides or lipids in milk acting directly in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Lactose has been known to increase calcium absorption; galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are derived from lactose and are non-digestible oligosaccharides. They have been shown to improve mineral balance and bone properties as well as causing increases in bifidobacteria in the gut, therefore a prebiotic effect. Supplementation with fortified milk and dairy products with added prebiotics, increased both calcium and magnesium absorption and caused some modulation of gut microbiota in animals and humans. Fermented milk is now also recognized to contain highly active components such as vitamins, peptides, oligosaccharides, and organic acids. In this review, the role of milk and milk components in improving calcium absorption and thereby supporting bone health is discussed. In addition, some reference is made to the significance of combining the inherent beneficial components from milk with fortificants/nutrients that will support bone health through adulthood.

Salt tea is brewed in a unique way in Kashmir, usually with addition of sodium bicarbonate, which makes salt tea alkaline. As little information about the association between salt tea drinking and ESCC was available, we conducted a large-scale case-control study to investigate this association in Kashmir. We recruited 703 histologically confirmed cases of ESCC and 1664 controls individually matched to cases for age, sex, and district of residence. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Participants who consumed >1,250 ml day(-1) showed an increased risk of ESCC (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.60, 95% CIs<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.68-4.02). Samovar (a special vessel for the beverage preparation) users (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.77, 95% CIs 1.25-2.50) and those who ate cereal paste with salt tea (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.14, 95% CIs<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.55-2.94) or added bicarbonate sodium to salt tea (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.12, 95% CIs<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.33-3.39) were at higher risk of ESCC than others. When analysis was limited to alkaline tea drinkers only, those who both consumed cereal paste with salt tea and used samovar vessel were at the highest risk (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.58, 95% CIs<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.04-10.28).

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   Cereal grains and their products provide around 30% of total energy intake in British adults, (much more than any of the other major food groups). Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the largest single cause of death in Britain and many other Western countries. This review examines the question whether there is a relation between cereal consumption and CHD. Several of the nutrients in cereals have known potential for reducing risk factors for CHD: the linoleic acid, fibre, vitamin E, selenium and folate. Cereals also contain phytoestrogens of the lignan family and several phenolic acids with antioxidant properties. Processing generally reduces the content of these nutrients and bioprotective substances. Although cereals at the farm gate are very low in salt, processed cereal foods, eg bread and some breakfast cereals, are high-salt foods and thus could contribute to raising blood pressure. Human experiments have clearly shown that oat fibre tends to lower plasma total and LDL cholesterol but wheat fibre does not. Rice bran and barley may also lower cholesterol but most people do not eat enough barley to have an effect. Cereal foods with low glycaemic index such as pasta and oats are beneficial for people with diabetes and might lower plasma lipids. Between 1996 and 2001 an accumulation of five very large cohort studies in the USA, Finland and Norway have all reported that subjects consuming relatively large amounts of whole grain cereals have significantly lower rates of CHD. This confirms an earlier report from a small British cohort. The protective effect does not seem to be due to cholesterol-lowering. While cohort studies have shown this consistent protective effect of whole grain cereals, there has been (only one) randomised controlled secondary prevention trial of advice to eat more cereal fibre. In this there was no reduction of the rate of reinfarction. The trial had some weaknesses, eg there were eight different diets, compliance was not checked objectively, and duration was for only 2 y. It appears valid to make health claims (as now permitted by the US FDA) that whole grain cereal foods and oat meal or bran may reduce the risk of CHD.

[INST]  Find all food-related entities mentioned in the text:   Asthma induced by cereal flour is a long recognized entity. We present studies of three patients affected by asthma related to exposure to cereal flour contained in animal formula feeds. Skin prick test performed with the formula feed components showed positive reactions to cereal flours (wheat, rye and barley) and negative to the other substances in these formulas. Specific anti-wheat, rye and barley flour IgE antibodies were found by RAST. Bronchial provocation tests (BPT) with wheat flour (patients 1 and 2) and barley flour (patient 3) all showed immediate responses. These findings suggest that our patients' symptoms were caused by an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cereal flours from animal formula feeds. We call attention to the importance of cereal flours in animal formula feeds as a cause of occupational asthma in farm and animal feeders.

Proteins were supplied by skim milk powder. Patterns of changes with time after feeding were observed for the composition and pH of duodenal digesta, recovery rates of fresh and dry matter, rates of abomasum emptying for fresh and dry matter, gastric proteolysis, and diarrhea. The composition and pH of duodenal digesta changed markedly with time after feeding, but the only notable differences between milk replacers were for contents of protein nitrogen and total nitrogen. Recovery rates of fresh matter were higher than 100%, presumably due to salivary and gastric secretions. Dry matter was recovered at a rate averaging 100% suggesting that the method used to measure the flow rate and sample duodenal digesta was adequate. The highest flow rates of fresh matter were during the first 3 h after feeding. Differences were marked among the flow rates of constituents of dry matter. Gastric proteolysis was not influenced by the nature of dietary fats. Fecal dry matter, a measure of the severity of diarrhea, was markedly lower for the milk replacer filled with corn oil than for the other two milk replacers.

Oleuropein is the ester of elenolic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethanol (HT). It is the main glycoside in olives, the degradation of which results in the formation of hydroxytyrosol in olive oil. Both plays a significant role in the reduction of coronary heart diseases and a certain type of cancers. Both olive oil phenols have an effective role counter to cell proliferation, cell growth, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. They down regulate the expression of BCL-2 and COX-2 proteins, and reduced DNA damage. Hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein inhibited the multiple stages in colon carcinogenesis; initiation, promotion, and metastasis. They also provide protection against various human cancers including colorectal, skin, breast, thyroid, digestive, lung, brain, blood, and cervical.

There is evidence that excessive or binge alcohol consumption is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as with work related and traffic accidents. On the contrary, at the moment, several epidemiological studies have suggested that moderate consumption of alcohol reduces overall mortality, mainly from coronary diseases. However, there are discrepancies regarding the specific effects of different types of beverages (wine, beer and spirits) on the cardiovascular system and cancer, and also whether the possible protective effects of alcoholic beverages are due to their alcoholic content (ethanol) or to their non-alcoholic components (mainly polyphenols). Epidemiological and clinical studies have pointed out that regular and moderate wine consumption (one to two glasses a day) is associated with decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, including colon, basal cell, ovarian, and prostate carcinoma. Moderate beer consumption has also been associated with these effects, but to a lesser degree, probably because of beer's lower phenolic content. These health benefits have mainly been attributed to an increase in antioxidant capacity, changes in lipid profiles, and the anti-inflammatory effects produced by these alcoholic beverages. This review summarizes the main protective effects on the cardiovascular system and cancer resulting from moderate wine and beer intake due mainly to their common components, alcohol and polyphenols.

[INST]  Find all mentions of food-related entities in the text:   Dairy production plays an important role in the lives of many people in Rwanda and Nepal. The aim of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems (LSIL; Gainesville, FL) is to introduce new location-appropriate technologies and to improve management practices, skills, knowledge, capacity, and access to inputs across livestock value chains in developing countries such as Rwanda and Nepal. To assist LSIL, our first aim was to describe gaps in the management of cows and in milk processing that constrain milk quality and quantity in Rwanda and Nepal. Our second aim was to describe training-of-trainers workshops in both countries as an initial response to the findings from the first objective. We conducted literature reviews and did rapid needs assessments in both countries. The literature reviews revealed similar aspects of the challenges of smallholder crop-livestock mixed farming systems in both countries. Many farms are struggling with feed quality, reproduction, and health of dairy cows. Milk production per cow and quality is often low. Fresh milk is collected by milk collection and cooling centers. Hygiene and milk processing capability and shelf life of products can be improved. Local rapid needs assessments were conducted in 2016 (Rwanda) and 2017 (Nepal) through visits to farms, milk collection and chilling centers, and processing plants, and through discussions with local dairy officials. The assessments supplemented and completed our understanding of stakeholders' needs in management and processing of milk. Limiting factors to improving the productivity, quality, and safety of milk in Rwanda and Nepal were a combination of sometimes limited knowledge in areas such as feeding, mastitis control, and hygiene, and a lack of access to resources such as quality feeds, transportation, and cooling that hindered implementation of existing knowledge. Training-of-trainers workshops in milk processing and hygiene were developed and given in Rwanda and Nepal based on the rapid needs assessments, and these were well received. We concluded that Rwanda and Nepal both have smallholder dairy farms that often face similar challenges such as lack of quality feeds, needs for basic dairy management education, low cattle productivity, and undesirable milk quality. Training-of-trainers programs to address these basic issues may be successful. Continued improvements in the dairy value chain depend on available resources for education.

[INST]  Extract all references to food items from the text:   The objective of the study was to determine the effects of adding flaxseed or fish oil to the diet on the milk fatty acid profile of cows. The experiment was conducted in the summer of 2006 and involved 24 Friesian cows that were divided into 3 groups of 8 animals according to different type of fat supplementation: a traditional diet with no fat supplementation, a diet supplemented with whole flaxseed, and a diet supplemented with fish oil. Results suggested that whole flaxseed supplementation positively affects the milk fatty acid profile during summer. In particular, milk from cows receiving flaxseed supplementation showed a decrease in saturated fatty acid, an increase in monounsaturated fatty acid, and, together with the milk from fish oil-supplemented cows, an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acid content compared with milk from control cows. As expected, both fish oil and flaxseed supplementation increased the content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk fat. The increased dietary intake of C18:3 in flaxseed-supplemented cows resulted in increased levels of milk C18:1 trans-11 and increased conjugated linoleic acid C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 by Delta(9)-desaturase activity. Milk from flaxseed-supplemented cows together with the high conjugated linoleic acid content was characterized by low atherogenic and thrombogenic indices, suggesting that its use has less detrimental effects concerning the atherosclerosis and coronary thrombosis risk associated with the consumption of milk and dairy products. In conclusion, flaxseed supplementation improves composition and nutritional properties of milk from cows milked during times of high ambient temperature.

Male Wistar rats fed lifelong on diets differing in the fat source were killed at 6 and at 24 months of age. Liver histopathology, mitochondrial ultrastructure, biogenesis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial electron transport chain, relative telomere length and gene expression profiles were studied. Aging led to lipid accumulation in the liver. Virgin olive oil led to the lowest oxidation and ultrastructural alterations. Sunflower oil induced fibrosis, ultrastructural alterations and high oxidation. Fish oil intensified oxidation associated with age, lowered electron transport chain activity and enhanced the relative telomere length. Gene expression changes associated with age in animals fed virgin olive oil and fish oil were related mostly to mitochondrial function and oxidative stress pathways, followed by cell cycle and telomere length control. Sunflower oil avoided gene expression changes related to age. According to the results, virgin olive oil might be considered the dietary fat source that best preserves the liver during the aging process.

These pesticides after consumption have a detrimental effect on human health and their intake can lead to various diseases such as kidney damage, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, circulatory and reproductive problems. The recent study was designed to assess the effects of household processing treatments such as acidic solutions (acidic acid and citric acid), alkaline solutions (sodium chloride and sodium carbonate) and biological solutions (radish, ginger, garlic, and lemon extracts) were evaluated for their efficiency for removal of pesticides in spinach by gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD). The results showed that pesticide residues were sharply reduced when spinach was exposed to washing treatments. The results showed that the greatest reduction of deltamethrin, cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos and endosulfan with 10% acetic acid was (79.68<U+2009><U+00B1><U+2009>0.81%), (89.99<U+2009><U+00B1><U+2009>0.12%), (94.21<U+2009><U+00B1><U+2009>0.02%) and (70.32<U+2009><U+00B1><U+2009>0.25%), respectively of tested washing solutions.

[INST]  Identify all references to food entities in the text:   The objective of this study was to derive food-based dietary guidelines for the Dutch population. The dietary guidelines are based on 29 systematic reviews of English language meta-analyses in PubMed summarizing randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies on nutrients, foods and food patterns and the risk of 10 major chronic diseases: coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, diabetes, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia and depression. The committee also selected three causal risk factors for cardiovascular diseases or diabetes: systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body weight. Findings were categorized as strong or weak evidence, inconsistent effects, too little evidence or effect unlikely for experimental and observational data separately. Next, the committee selected only findings with a strong level of evidence for deriving the guidelines. Convincing evidence was based on strong evidence from the experimental data either or not in combination with strong evidence from prospective cohort studies. Plausible evidence was based on strong evidence from prospective cohort studies only. A general guideline to eat a more plant food-based dietary pattern and limit consumption of animal-based food and 15 specific guidelines have been formulated. There are 10 new guidelines on legumes, nuts, meat, dairy produce, cereal products, fats and oils, tea, coffee and sugar-containing beverages. Three guidelines on vegetables, fruits, fish and alcoholic beverages have been sharpened, and the 2006 guideline on salt stayed the same.

Heavy metals in the edible parts of vegetables also exceeded the corresponding standards. The leaves of pakchoi, peppermint, and coriander had a strong metal-accumulative ability and they were not suitable for planting. Except the residue forms, the main forms of metals in the edible parts of three selected vegetables were ethanol-, NaCl-, and HAc-extractable fractions for As, Pb, and Cd, respectively; however, Cu was mainly presented as NaCl-extractable and Zn as HAc-extractable fractions. A high proportion of ethanol-extractable As showed that As bioactivity and toxic effects were the highest. Although the total and bioavailable Cd were high in soil, its speciation in vegetables was mainly presented as HAc-extractable fraction, which has a relatively low bioactivity. Lead and arsenic were imposing a serious threat on the local residents via vegetable consumption.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   To estimate the effects of consuming hot beverages, including mate (an infusion of the herb Ilex paraguayensis), tea, coffee and coffee with milk, and other food items on esophageal cancer risk, we analyzed data from 830 cases and 1,779 controls participating in a series of 5 hospital-based case-control studies of squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus conducted in high-risk areas of South America. After adjusting for the strong effects of tobacco and alcohol consumption, both heavy mate drinking (>1 l/day) and self-reported very hot mate drinking were significantly associated with esophageal cancer risk in men and women. The magnitude and strength of the association for mate amount and, to a lesser extent, mate temperature were higher for women than men. The joint effects of mate amount and mate temperature were more than multiplicative, following a statistically significant synergistic interaction (p = 0.02) which was particularly evident among heavy drinkers (>1.50 l/day) of very hot mate (odds ratio = 4.14, 95% confidence interval: 2.24-7.67) compared to light drinkers (<0.50 l/day) of cold/warm/hot mate. Consumption of other very hot beverages, such as tea and coffee with milk but not coffee alone, was also significantly associated with an increased risk, in the 2- to 4-fold range. Statistically significant protective associations were identified for high consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals and tea. In contrast, frequent consumption of meat, animal fats and salt was associated with a moderately increased risk. This pooled analysis adds evidence for a carcinogenic effect of chronic thermal injury in the esophagus induced by the consumption of very hot drinks, including mate. Our study further confirms the protective effect of a dietary pattern characterized by daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and low consumption of meat and animal fats.

Various biological activities of <U+03B2>-glucans have been reported such as anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects. The importance of <U+03B2>-glucans in food processing industries such as bread preparation, yogurt and pasta have been well elucidated. In recent findings on food science research gut microbiota plays a significant role and vastly studied for its intermediate role in regulating health. Several reports have suggested that <U+03B2>-glucans should have a significant impact on the gut microbiota changes and in turn on human health. The review was aimed to accumulate the evidence on types of <U+03B2>-glucans, their functional properties and the mechanism by how the <U+03B2>-glucans regulate the gut microbiota and human health. The various in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, have been summarized, in particular, the changes happening upon the <U+03B2>-glucans supplementation on the gut microbiota.

Adequate consumption of milk and dairy products, especially during childhood, has beneficial health outcomes for growth, development, and reduced risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, obesity, and cancer during adulthood. Satisfaction with milk flavor, perceived health benefits derived from milk, and habit are primary drivers of lifelong milk consumption. Child preferences and attitudes for milk may differ from those of adults, and as such, understanding and fulfilling the needs of children is crucial to reverse the decline in milk consumption. School meal programs make fluid milk accessible to millions of children each day; however, regulations and school lunch procurement systems in the United States sometimes make it difficult to provide novel or value-added milk products in these programs. Total consumption of all milk types in US schools declined by 14.2% from 2008 to 2017, and the percentage of children participating in the school lunch program has also declined. This decline has also been driven by declining average daily participation in the school meal program and may also reflect children's dissatisfaction with the sensory characteristics and the form of milk offered in schools. The change in form of milk offered in schools to lower fat and lower added sugar content in the United States has been driven by government-mandated school lunch calorie and fat requirements. This review describes the current milk consumption trends among children; the structure and basic requirements of the school lunch program in total and for milk; and the intrinsic, extrinsic, and environmental factors that influence child perception, preference, and consumption of fluid milk in the US school system.

The aim of this review was to objectively evaluate the existing evidence related to green tea consumption and various health outcomes, especially cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This review captured evidence from meta-analyses as well as expert reports and recent individual studies. For certain individual cancer sites: endometrial, lung, oral and ovarian cancer, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma the majority of meta-analyses observed an inverse association with green tea. Mixed findings were observed for breast, esophageal, gastric, liver and a mostly null association for colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. No studies reported adverse effects from green tea related to cancer although consuming hot tea has been found to possibly increase the risk of esophageal cancer and concerns of hepatotoxity were raised as a result of high doses of green tea. The literature overall supports an inverse association between green tea and cardiovascular disease-related health outcomes. The evidence for diabetes-related health outcomes is less convincing, while the included meta-analyses generally suggested an inverse association between green tea and BMI-related and blood pressure outcomes. Fewer studies investigated the association between green tea and other health outcomes such as cognitive outcomes, dental health, injuries and respiratory disease.

Subjects rated their liking of French toast, sausage and the overall meal, or chicken, vegetables, pasta, and the overall meal on a 9-point hedonic Likert scale. Overall liking of the RF breakfast and lunch meals were lower than the FF and RFS versions (breakfast: 6.50 RF compared with 6.84 FF, P = 0.0061; 6.50 RF compared with 6.82 RFS, P = 0.0030; lunch: 6.35 RF compared with 6.94 FF, P < 0.0001; 6.35 RF compared with 6.71 RFS, P = 0.0061).

[INST]  Locate all mentions of food in the text:   Mugwort and birch pollen allergy are frequently associated with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to celery and spices. We analyzed 22 sera from patients with the mugwort-birch-celery-spice syndrome for IgE binding to the spices pepper and paprika by immunoblotting. Immunoblot results revealed two major allergens of 28 and 60 kDa in pepper and a 23-kDa allergen together with allergens of higher molecular weight in paprika. In immunoblot-inhibition studies, crude mugwort, birch pollen, and celery extracts significantly reduced the IgE binding to pepper and paprika allergens. However, no inhibition was achieved with rBet v 1 and rBet v 2, suggesting that no homologs of these birch proteins act as allergens in pepper or paprika extracts. N-terminal sequence analysis of the 14- and 28-kDa pepper and 23-kDa paprika allergens revealed no homology to known allergens. The 28-kDa pepper allergen showed homology to a wheat germin protein, and the 23-kDa paprika allergen was identified as a homolog of a osmotin-like or pathogenesis-related protein in tomato. Therefore, we conclude that the IgE cross-reactivity in the mugwort-birch-celery-spice syndrome to the spices pepper and paprika is not caused by homologs of Bet v 1 and profilin.

Adolescents' poor dietary habits increase their subsequent risk of degenerative diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular pathologies, etc. Our aim was to study nutritional modifications during COVID-19 confinement in adolescents aged 10 to 19 years, compare them with their usual diet and dietary guidelines, and identify variables that may have influenced changes. Data were collected by an anonymous online questionnaire on food intake among 820 adolescents from Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile. The results show that COVID-19 confinement did influence their dietary habits. In particular, we recorded modified consumption of fried food, sweet food, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. Moreover, gender, family members at home, watching TV during mealtime, country of residence, and maternal education were diversely correlated with adequate nutrition during COVID-19 confinement. Understanding the adolescents' nutrition behavior during COVID-19 lockdown will help public health authorities reshape future policies on their nutritional recommendations, in preparation for future pandemics.

However, the molecular targets in the genome are mostly unknown. The present study investigated the effects of vegetable consumption on gene expression in the colon mucosa of female C57Bl/6 mice using cDNA microarray technology. Mice were fed one of 8 diets: a control diet containing no vegetables (diet 1); a diet containing 100 g/kg (diet 2, 10% dose), 200 g/kg (diet 3, 20% dose), or 400 g/kg (diet 4, 40% dose) of a vegetable mixture; or a diet containing 70 g/kg of cauliflower (diet 5, 7% dose), 73 g/kg of carrots (diet 6, 7.3% dose), 226 g/kg of peas (diet 7, 22.6% dose); or 31 g/kg of onions (diet 8, 3.1% dose). The vegetable mixture used in diets 2 to 4 consisted of the 4 individual vegetables used in diets 5 to 8: cauliflower (30% wet wt), carrots (30% wet wt), peas (30% wet wt), and onions (10% wet wt). To assess gene expression changes, colonic mucosal cells were collected after the mice were killed. Total RNA was isolated and microarray technology was used to measure the expression levels of 602 genes simultaneously. For 39 genes, significant dose-dependent effects were found, although in general the relations were not linear. For 15 genes, the altered expression could indeed explain reduced cancer risk at various stages of CRC development. Eleven genes were modulated by the vegetable mixture as well as by one or more of the individual vegetables. For 7 of the genes, the modulation by the mixture was due to the effect of a particular vegetable. These genes are of particular interest because they were consistently affected and could be involved in the prevention of CRC by vegetable consumption.

[INST]  Find all food entities present in the text:   Polyphenols are the most abundant antioxidants in the diet and are widespread constituents of fruits, vegetables, cereals, dry legumes, chocolate, and beverages, such as tea, coffee, or wine. Experimental studies on animals or cultured human cell lines support a role of polyphenols in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, or osteoporosis. However, it is very difficult to predict from these results the effects of polyphenol intake on disease prevention in humans. One of the reasons is that these studies have often been conducted at doses or concentrations far beyond those documented in humans. The few clinical studies on biomarkers of oxidative stress, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and tumor or bone resorption biomarkers have often led to contradictory results. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown an inverse association between the risk of myocardial infarction and the consumption of tea and wine or the intake level of some particular flavonoids, but no clear associations have been found between cancer risk and polyphenol consumption. More human studies are needed to provide clear evidence of their health protective effects and to better evaluate the risks possibly resulting from too high a polyphenol consumption.

In this study, total lipids (TL) of Greek olive oils and seed oils of four kinds, namely, soybean, corn, sunflower, and sesame oil, were separated into total polar lipids (TPL) and total neutral lipids (TNL) via a novel extraction procedure. TPL and TNL of olive oil were fractionated by HPLC for further study. Each lipid fraction from HPLC separation along with TL, TPL, and TNL lipid samples from oils were tested in vitro for their capacity to induce or to inhibit washed rabbit platelet aggregation. Comparison between olive and seed oils supports the superiority of olive oil as high levels of platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonists have been detected, mainly in TPL. In addition, the structure of the most active fraction from olive oil was elucidated, as a glycerol-glycolipid. Because it has already been reported that PAF plays a pivotal role in atherogenesis, the existence of PAF agonists and antagonists in vegetable oils may explain their protective role against atherosclerosis.

This review encompasses epidemiologic studies of stomach, colon, and lung cancer as well as the evidence of a relationship between tea drinking and cancer at large in humans. Cohort studies do not suggest a protective role for tea drinking in the total risk of cancer. Site-specific studies reveal a more complex picture. The epidemiologic studies on tea drinking and stomach cancer do not justify claims of a cancer-protective effect. A protective effect of green tea on the development of colon cancer is suggested. The evidence regarding black tea is less clear, with some indication of a risk of colon or rectal cancer associated with regular use of black tea. The studies on tea and lung cancer also suggest an increased risk with increased tea consumption. The range and crude categorization of tea consumption, choice of control groups, and inadequate control for confounding might have obscured possible relationships.

This report examines associations of various food groups with colon cancer in African-Americans and Caucasians from a case-control study. Incident cases of histologically confirmed colon cancer, age 40-80 years, (n = 613) and matched controls (n = 996) were interviewed in-person to ascertain potential colon cancer risk factors. Diet over the year before diagnosis or interview date was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire adapted to include regional foods. Multivariate logistic regression models estimated energy-adjusted and non-energy adjusted odds ratios (OR). Controls generally reported higher consumption (daily amount and weekly frequency) of fruits, vegetables and dark green, deep yellow fruits/vegetables, whereas cases consumed more refined carbohydrates and fats, oils and snacks. Regardless of ethnic group or energy adjustment, high and frequent vegetable consumption (particularly dark green vegetables) was protective, consistent with 20-50% reductions in risk. In Caucasians, high refined carbohydrate and red meat consumption (amount and frequency) was associated with a statistically significant 2-fold increased risk in non-energy adjusted models. In African-Americans, frequent intake of dairy foods was associated with a doubling in risk (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.4) in non-energy-adjusted models, whereas frequent fruit consumption correlated with a non-significant 30% lower risk. These findings add to growing evidence that plant foods may protect against colon cancer; however, the effects of the other food groups varied by ethnic group and energy adjustment. These results may also explain some of the ethnic differences in colon cancer incidence.

Tea, red wine and cocoa are good sources of flavanols and these highly consumed foods might contribute to prevent diabetes. In this regard, there is increasing evidence for a protective effect of tea, red wine and cocoa consumption against this disorder. This review summarizes the available epidemiological and interventional human studies providing evidence for and against this effect. Overall observational data suggest a benefit, but results are still equivocal and likely confounded by lifestyle and background dietary factors. The weight of data indicate favourable effects on diabetes risk factors for tea, red wine and cocoa intake, and a number of plausible mechanisms have been elucidated in human studies.

It has very strong adaptability to adverse environments with a very short growing span. Many varieties are growing around the world, but mainly in the north hemisphere. Currently the most common buckwheat spice is Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (common buckwheat or sweet buckwheat), while Fagopyrum tartaricum is also available in some mountainous regions. Many nutraceutical compounds exist in buckwheat seeds and other tissues. Buckwheat has been used and will be better used as an important raw material for functional food production. In this review we focus on works related to the development of functional foods from common buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench. A lot of research has be conducted in the functionalities and properties of buckwheat proteins, flavonoids, flavones, phytosterols, thiamin-binding proteins, and other rare compounds in buckwheat seeds. Buckwheat proteins have unique amino acid composition with special biological activities of cholesterol-lowering effects, antihypertensition effects, and improving the constipation and obisity conditions by acting similar as to dietary fiber and interrupting the in vivo metabolisms. The trypsin inhibitors isolated from buckwheat seeds are heat stable and can cause poor digestion if they are not suitably cooked before consumption. The allergenic proteins existing in the buckwheat seeds and their derivatives were reviewed with respect to their chemical and biochemical characteristics as well as the physiological reactions after digestion. Some possible mechanisms involved in these effects are discussed in this review. Experiments, both with animal models and with human beings, revealed that buckwheat flour can improve diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and constipation.

The authors conducted a case-control study in Hawaii and Los Angeles, California, to examine several dietary hypotheses regarding the etiology of ovarian cancer in a population with a broad range of dietary intakes. A total of 558 patients with ovarian cancer diagnosed in 1993-1999 and 607 controls were interviewed regarding their diet. Consumption of all dairy products, all types of milk, and low-fat milk, but not consumption of whole milk, was significantly inversely related to the odds of ovarian cancer. Similar inverse gradients in the odds ratios were obtained for intakes of lactose and calcium, although these nutrients were highly correlated (r = 0.77). The odds ratio for ovarian cancer was 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.27, 0.76) among women in the highest quartile of dietary calcium intake versus the lowest (p for trend = 0.0006). The significant dietary association was limited to dairy sources of calcium (p for trend = 0.003), although a nonsignificant inverse gradient in risk was also found in relation to calcium supplement intake. These results suggest that intake of low-fat milk, calcium, or lactose may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.

The Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study was a multi-institutional randomized trial in 3088 women at risk for breast cancer recurrence. At baseline, the average participant followed a healthy dietary pattern of 7 vegetable and fruit servings, 21 g/d of fiber, and 28.7% energy from fat, although fat intake increased over the enrollment period. Using primarily telephone counseling, the intervention group was encouraged to substantially increase intakes of vegetables, fruits, and fiber while decreasing fat intake. Sets of 24-h dietary recalls were completed on 90% of eligible participants at 1 y and 86% at 4 y. Using a conservative imputation analysis, at 1 y, the intervention group consumed 38% more vegetable servings (100% when including juice) than the comparison group, 20% more fruit, 38% more fiber, 50% more legumes, and 30% more whole grain foods, with a 20% lower intake of energy from fat. At 4 y, the between-group differences were 65% for vegetables (including juice), 25% fruit, 30% fiber, 40% legumes, 30% whole grain foods, and 13% lower intake of energy from fat. The intervention effect on fat intake was similar for early vs. late enrollees. Plasma carotenoid concentrations on a random 28% sample validated self-reported vegetable and fruit intake, with a between-group difference of 66% at 1 y and over 40% at 4 y.

We developed a 'dietary gap assessment' to evaluate the degree to which a nation's food supply could support healthy diets at the population level. Design/Setting In the absence of global food-based dietary guidelines, we selected the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as an example because there is evidence it prevents diet-related chronic disease and supports adequate micronutrient intakes. We used the DASH guidelines to shape a hypothetical 'healthy' diet for the test country of Cameroon. Food availability was estimated using FAO Food Balance Sheet data on country-level food supply. For each of the seven food groups in the 'healthy' diet, we calculated the difference between the estimated national supply (in kcal, edible portion only) and the target amounts.

[INST]  Identify all food-related entities present in the text:   Bamboos, a group of large woody grasses belonging to the family Poaceae and subfamily Bambusoideae, are much talked about for their contribution to the environment. However, the food potential of Bamboo shoot per se remains unexploited. Literature on the nutritional and medicinal potential of bamboo shoots is scarce. This paper therefore provides insight on bamboo shoot as a food resource. Various edible species and exotic food products (fermented shoots, pickle, etc.) and recipes of bamboo shoots (bamboo beer, bamboo cookies) are consumed worldwide. Change in nutritional composition of different species of bamboo shoots with processing has also been reviewed. Bamboo shoots possess high protein, moderate fiber, and less fat content. They are also endowed for having essential amino acids, selenium, a potent antioxidant, and potassium, a healthy heart mineral. Occurrence of taxiphyllin, a cyanogenic glycoside in raw shoots, and its side effect on human health calls for the demand to innovate processing ways using scientific input to eliminate the toxic compound without disturbing the nutrient reserve. Lastly, the paper also reviews the utilization of medicinal properties acquired by bamboo shoot. Using the traditional knowledge, pharmaceutical preparations of bamboo shoots like bamboo salt, bamboo vinegar, bamboo extracts for diabetes and cholesterol control, etc. are now gaining importance. Further investigation is required by the researchers to make novel nutraceutical products and benefit the society.

[INST]  Find all food entities present in the text:   The effects of feeding a 5% corn oil or coconut oil diet on the composition of hepatic phospholipid fatty acids and on hepatic mitochondrial function were studied. Male BHE weanling rats were fed a 65% starch diet containing 5% corn or coconut oil. Rats were decapitated, and hepatic tissue was used for phospholipid fatty acid analysis and for the preparation of mitochondria. Mitochondrial ATPase activity, alpha-glycerophosphate and malate-aspartate shuttle activity, and succinate- or pyruvate-supported respiration were determined. Livers from rats fed the coconut oil diet had more saturated phospholipid fatty acids than those from rats fed the corn oil diet. ATPase activity and the activity of the malate-aspartate shuttle were not affected by diet. The activity of the alpha-glycerophosphate shuttle was greater in rats fed the coconut oil diet than in rats fed the corn oil diet. Succinate-supported state 3 respiration was not affected by diet, whereas succinate-supported state 4 respiration was higher in mitochondria from rats fed coconut oil than in rats fed corn oil. Evidence of uncoupling of pyruvate-supported respiration from ATP synthesis was observed in mitochondria from rats fed coconut oil but not in rats fed corn oil. These observations suggest that the inherent tendency of the BHE rat toward looser coupling of respiration to ATP synthesis is potentiated by the feeding of the highly saturated fat, hydrogenated coconut oil.

Differences in growth among treatments an affect iron bioavailability determinations when change in hemoglobin concentration is used as the criterion. The amount and source of fat was varied in diets fed to anemic rats for assaying the bioavailability of iron from turkey meat. It was observed that gain in body weight increased as the amount of fat in the diet increased and concurrently, that the gain in hemoglobin concentration decreased. By expressing iron bioavailability as the efficiency of the conversion of dietary iron into hemoglobin, it was demonstrated that the amount of fat in the diet did not affect the bioavailability of iron from turkey meat or from ferrous sulfate. It was found that animals fed beef fat were most efficient at converting iron from turkey meat into hemoglobin followed by those fed turkey fat, corn oil and pork fat in descending order.

Among the food items we examined, cheese was most closely correlated with the incidence of testicular cancer at ages 20-39, followed by animal fats and milk. The correlation coefficient (r) was highest (r = 0.804) when calculated for cheese consumed during the period 1961-65 (maternal or prepubertal consumption). Stepwise-multiple-regression analysis revealed that milk + cheese (1961-65) made a significant contribution to the incidence of testicular cancer (standardized regression coefficient [R] = 0.654). Concerning prostatic cancer, milk (1961-90) was most closely correlated (r = 0.711) with its incidence, followed by meat and coffee. Stepwise-multiple-regression analysis identified milk + cheese as a factor contributing to the incidence of prostatic cancer (R = 0.525). The food that was most closely correlated with the mortality rate of prostatic cancer was milk (r = 0.766), followed by coffee, cheese and animal fats. Stepwise-multiple-regression analysis revealed that milk + cheese was a factor contributing to mortality from prostatic cancer (R = 0.580). The results of our study suggest a role of milk and dairy products in the development and growth of testicular and prostatic cancers. The close correlation between cheese and testicular cancer and between milk and prostatic cancer suggests that further mechanistic studies should be undertaken concerning the development of male genital organ cancers.

Responses from 43 dairy farms in Scotland showed that milk losses occurred due to withdrawal periods for veterinary treatment, parlor infrastructure, and lapses in management routine. A partial life cycle assessment detailed flows of milk from cow to farm gate and captured farm inputs such as imported feeds and fertilizers. Incidence of animal health events such as mastitis, that routinely lead to milk withdrawal were quantified alongside strategies carried out by farmers to reduce milk loss. Treatment for mastitis accounted for 76% of all milk withdrawal days and the remaining 24% stemmed from therapies for health events such as uterine disorders and lameness. Withdrawal periods for mastitis treatments averaged 4.5 days, with a mean incidence of 20% of cows in a herd. Across all farms, an average of 98.2% of total milk produced was sold, 0.66% was purposely retained, 0.55% was rejected due to antibiotic residues, 0.5% was lost from parlor to bulk tank infrastructure and a further 0.09% was rejected by the processor.

[INST]  Identify all food entities mentioned in the text:   Barley is one of the most important cereal crops and arranged globally as fourth after wheat, rice, and corn. It is known for its beneficial effects against degenerative diseases including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and colon inflammation which are associated with eating habits and improper lifestyles. These effects are mainly attributed to its rich dietary fibers, i.e., <U+03B2>-glucan composition. Moreover, barley considered as a good source of starch, minerals, vitamins, and protein pose it as an ideal food supplement. Nevertheless, about 2% of the barley global production is utilized due to unacceptable organoleptic characters. Therefore, continuous modifications are ongoing either to develop new cultivars for different purposes, or novel processing methods to improve its organoleptic characters. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the macroconstituents and microconstituents of barley, its nutritional value and prebiotic effects. Further, different processing procedures performed to improve its organoleptic characters or to decrease its antinutrient levels are outlined with suggestions for further needed cultivars that could preserve the different benefits of barley and maximize its value as a major cereal crop.

RBO and SPC were used due to their health benefit claims such as lowering risk of heart disease. The effects of the proportions of high-impact ingredients (RBO, SPC, and water) on sensory acceptability of the spreads were determined. The 10 spread formulations, prepared following a 3-component constrained simplex lattice mixture design, were subjected to a consumer acceptance test to identify sensory attributes driving consumer acceptance and purchase intent. Predictive regression models were used to plot mixture response surfaces of the critical sensory attributes (taste, mouthfeel, and overall liking) that influenced purchase intent. Areas within the contour plots of these critical sensory attributes, having acceptability scores > or = 68 ("moderately like" on the 100-mm bidirectional labeled affective magnitude scale) were chosen and superimposed to obtain a predicted optimum formulation range (37% to 43% RBO, 4% to 7% SPC, and 52% to 57% water). The formulation containing 37% RBO, 6% SPC, and 57% water, which was located within the optimum region, was selected as a base for further developing flavored (sour cream & onion, cheddar & sour cream, or Monterrey Jack dried cheese) products.

Food manufacturers have the responsibility to declare the presence of walnuts on packaged foods even when trace residues may be present from the use of shared equipment or the adventitious contamination of ingredients. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, sensitive, and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for the detection of walnut protein residues. Mixtures of raw and roasted English walnuts of several varieties were defatted, powdered, and used as separate antigens in sheep and New Zealand white rabbits. An ELISA was developed using the sheep antiroasted walnut serum as the capture reagent and rabbit antiroasted walnut serum as the detector reagent followed by addition of commercial goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase and subsequent substrate addition. The performance of the ELISA was validated by testing known amounts of walnut (0 to 100 ppm) either spiked into or manufactured into milk chocolate, cookies, muffins, or ice cream. Recoveries of 1 to 100 ppm walnut-in-chocolate ranged from 71.6% to 119%+/- 7% to 16.5%. The walnut ELISA has a detection limit of 1 ppm (1 microg/g) walnut in several food matrices. Substantial cross-reactivity was observed with pecan while minimal cross-reactivity was noted for hazelnut, mustard, mace, and poppy seed among almost 100 foods and food ingredients tested.

[INST]  Extract all food-related mentions from the text:   Researchers do not understand what causes ovarian cancer.  Some studies find galactose to be toxic to oocytes which renders ovaries susceptible to cancer.  1 hypothesis is that high levels of lactose consumption and retained ability to digest lactose (lactase persistence) lead to high levels of galactose exposure which increases the ovarian cancer risk.  Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland have the highest risk of ovarian cancer in the world.  They also have the highest levels of lactase persistence and among the highest levels of milk supply for the population.  Conversely, Hong Kong, Japan, Shanghai, and Singapore have low ovarian cancer risk, low consumption of milk, and low levels of lactase persistence.  yet other researchers using the same data did not find per capita availability of milk to be significant independent of nondairy animal fat.  Lactase persistence did have an independent association, however, but data was not standardized across populations.  In a case control study, researchers took the dietary history of 11 dairy products to measure lactose consumption.  A significant increase in ovarian cancer risk only existed with frequent intake of yogurt and cottage cheese.  Researchers hypothesized that the prehydrolyzed lactose in both foods was the main contributor.  Using the case control data, others found an increased risk for total lactose intake in women who never used oral contraceptives (OCs).  The strongest predictor to date is the lactose/transferase ratio, yet those who found this association did not define this index based on an earlier study or examination.  1 problem with these studies is that dietary fat confounds the association.  2 studies showed that low fat milk was associated with decreased risk, even though both milks have the same lactose content.  Another problem is that the subsets of exposure or subgroups of the population are unpredictable.  Further research in nutritional epidemiology of ovarian cancer is needed.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms referenced in the text:   Recent surveys have identified the presence of perchlorate, a natural compound and environmental contaminant, in forages and dairy milk. The ingestion of perchlorate is of concern because of its ability to competitively inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid and to impair synthesis of thyroid hormones. A recent study established that milk perchlorate concentrations in cattle highly correlate with perchlorate intake. However, there is evidence that up to 80% of dietary perchlorate is metabolized in clinically healthy cows, thereby restricting the available transfer of ingested perchlorate into milk. The influence of mastitis on milk perchlorate levels, where there is an increase in mammary vascular permeability and an influx of blood-derived components into milk, remains unknown. The present study examined the effect of experimentally induced mastitis on milk perchlorate levels in cows receiving normal and perchlorate-supplemented diets. Over a 12-d period, cows were ruminally infused with 1 L/d of water or water containing 8 mg of perchlorate. Five days after the initiation of ruminal infusions, experimental mastitis was induced by the intramammary infusion of 100 microg of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Contralateral quarters infused with phosphate-buffered saline served as controls. A significant reduction in milk perchlorate concentration was observed in the LPS-challenged glands of animals ruminally infused with either water or perchlorate. In control glands, milk perchlorate concentrations remained constant throughout the study. A strong negative correlation was identified between mammary vascular permeability and milk perchlorate concentrations in LPS-infused glands. These findings, in the context of a recently published study, suggest that an active transport process is operative in the establishment of a perchlorate concentration gradient across the blood-mammary gland interface, and that increases in mammary epithelial and vascular endothelial permeability lead to a net outflow of milk perchlorate. The overall finding that mastitis results in lower milk perchlorate concentrations suggests that changes in udder health do not necessitate increased screening of milk for perchlorate.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms contained in the text:   Dietary fiber has been suggested to alter the colonic environment and protect against colorectal diseases, but several recent epidemiological studies indicate that cereal and vegetable fibers may not confer the same benefit. To address this issue, five common cereal brans (barley, corn, oat, rice, and wheat) and five vegetable fiber isolates (broccoli, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, and lettuce) were fermented in vitro with human fecal microbiota for 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), hydrogen (H2), and methane (CH4) productions and neutral-detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility differed significantly with fiber source. The vegetable fibers were significantly more fermentable than were the cereal brans, as evidenced by greater NDF digestibility and increased productions of SCFA, H2, and CH4, despite the presence of fermentable starch and protein in the latter. We concluded that vegetable fibers may more effectively stimulate colonic fermentation than cereal brans do. These findings suggest an attribute (i.e., fermentability) that may partially explain previously observed differences between vegetable and cereal fiber consumption patterns and colorectal carcinogenesis.

Following surgery, the women participated in a dietary history interview and were then randomized to one of two groups. The intervention group (n = 121) received individual dietary counselling aimed at reducing dietary fat intake to 20-25% energy (E%), whereas no dietary advice was given to women in the control group (n = 119). For the 52% of the women in the intervention group that completed the study the total fat intake decreased from 36 to 23 E% (P less than or equal to 0.01) and from 37 to 34 E% (P less than or equal to 0.01) for the control group. There were significant reductions in the intake of table fat, high-fat milk products, pork and sausages (containing greater than 11% fat), eggs, rice, pasta, cakes and chocolate for the intervention group. Concurrently the intake of vegetables, fruits, potatoes, bread, cereals, low-fat milk products, low-fat meat, sausages and fish increased significantly. For the control group there was a significant decrease in the consumption of total milk products, total meats, rice, pasta, cakes, and butter intake while the consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals and fish increased (P less than or equal to 0.01). Reduction of high-fat foods and increases of carbohydrate-rich foods were more pronounced for the intervention group than for the control group.

The evidence is summarised in the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research report Diet, Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer: a Global Perspective. The plasticity of cancer patterns implicates environmental factors as determinants of cancer, and nutrition influences key cellular and molecular processes that characterise cancer. Epidemiology identifies associations between aspects of diet, nutrition, and physical activity with one or more cancers; there is evidence for plausible mechanisms that imply that these are causal. Some nutritional exposures (alcohol and processed meat) are likely causal factors, but no singular factor protects against cancer (except dietary fibre for colorectal cancer). Cancer protection mainly derives from a systemic metabolic environment that promotes healthy cell replication and tissue integrity. Such a nutritional state reflects avoiding excess adiposity through healthy dietary patterns rich in plant foods (legumes, wholegrains, pulses, vegetables and fruits), with modest meat, fish and dairy, low in alcohol and salt preserved foods, and an active way of life, avoiding sedentary behaviours. Less is known about the impact of nutritional interventions in people with a diagnosis of cancer, but nutrition including adiposity and physical activity predict breast cancer outcome. Promoting healthy ways of life requires public information and education, but alone these do not generate change; a socio-political and cultural environment that is conducive to adopting healthy behaviours is needed. Uncertainties in the evidence offer promising directions for future research, but sufficient is known to act as a basis for public policy and clinical practice.

[INST]  Identify all food items mentioned in the text:   The calcium economy is a dynamic state influenced by fluxes in dietary calcium intake, intestinal calcium absorption, and renal calcium conservation. The relationship of selected bone-related nutrients to these calcium fluxes exhibits both constructive and destructive interactions that affect the overall state of calcium balance. The basis of the calcium requirement and the impact of vitamin D, protein, phosphorus, sodium, and caffeine on the calcium economy are reviewed. Against this background, emerging data on potassium are presented. Data from balance studies of healthy white women at midlife were reviewed to assess the effect of diet potassium on the calcium economy under steady-state conditions. Potassium was inversely associated with both urinary calcium excretion and intestinal calcium absorption, yielding no significant net change in calcium balance. In the population reported on here, dairy, meat, and cereal grains together contributed 56%, and fruits and vegetables 44%, of total dietary potassium. To the extent that fruit and vegetable potassium is a surrogate for high bicarbonate, this cohort did not have a dietary intake pattern allowing for measurement or interpretation of the potential effect of a high-bicarbonate-containing diet on long-term steady-state calcium balance. Potassium itself is uniformly well absorbed regardless of the dietary source. Mean 24-h urinary potassium averaged 92% of dietary intake. According to nationwide food consumption surveys, milk is the number 1 single food source of potassium in all age groups in the United States.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   Processed meat intake is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. This association may be explained by the endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC). The hypothesis that meat intake can increase fecal NOC levels and colon carcinogenesis was tested in 175 Fischer 344 rats. Initiation was assessed by the number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon of rats 45 days after the start of a high-fat bacon-based diet. Promotion was assessed by the multiplicity of ACF (crypts per ACF) in rats given experimental diets for 100 days starting 7 days after an azoxymethane injection. Three promotion studies were done, each in 5 groups of 10 rats, whose diets contained 7%, 14%, or 28% fat. Tested meats were bacon, pork, chicken, and beef. Fecal and dietary NOC were assayed by thermal energy analysis. Results show that feces from rats fed bacon-based diets contained 10-20 times more NOC than feces from control rats fed a casein-based diet (all p < 0.0001 in 4 studies). In bacon-fed rats, the amount of NOC input (diet) and output (feces) was similar. Rats fed a diet based on beef, pork, or chicken meat had less fecal NOC than controls (most p < 0.01). No ACF were detected in the colon of bacon-fed uninitiated rats. After azoxymethane injection, unprocessed but cooked meat-based diets did not change the number of ACF or the ACF multiplicity compared with control rats. In contrast, the bacon-based diet consistently reduced the number of large ACF per rat and the ACF multiplicity in the three promotion studies by 12%, 17%, and 20% (all p < 0.01). Results suggest that NOC from dietary bacon would not enhance colon carcinogenesis in rats.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food present in the text:   The association of habitual coffee consumption with a lower risk of diseases, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, certain cancer types, or with reduced all-cause mortality, has been confirmed in prospective cohort studies in many regions of the world. The molecular mechanism is still unresolved. The radical-scavenging and anti-inflammatory activity of coffee constituents is too weak to account for such effects. We argue here that coffee as a plant food has similar beneficial properties to many vegetables and fruits. Recent studies have identified a health promoting mechanism common to coffee, vegetables and fruits, i.e., the activation of an adaptive cellular response characterized by the upregulation of proteins involved in cell protection, notably antioxidant, detoxifying and repair enzymes. Key to this response is the activation of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2) system by phenolic phytochemicals, which induces the expression of cell defense genes. Coffee plays a dominant role in that regard because it is the major dietary source of phenolic acids and polyphenols in the developed world. A possible supportive action may be the modulation of the gut microbiota by non-digested prebiotic constituents of coffee, but the available data are still scarce. We conclude that coffee employs similar pathways of promoting health as assumed for other vegetables and fruits. Coffee beans may be viewed as healthy vegetable food and a main supplier of dietary phenolic phytochemicals.

[INST]  Extract all food items listed in the text:   It is not clear whether alcohol consumption is associated with lung cancer risk. The relationship is likely confounded by smoking, complicating the interpretation of previous studies. We examined the association of alcohol consumption and lung cancer risk in a large pooled international sample, minimizing potential confounding of tobacco consumption by restricting analyses to never smokers. Our study included 22 case-control and cohort studies with a total of 2548 never-smoking lung cancer patients and 9362 never-smoking controls from North America, Europe and Asia within the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and SYNERGY Consortium. Alcohol consumption was categorized into amounts consumed (grams per day) and also modelled as a continuous variable using restricted cubic splines for potential non-linearity. Analyses by histologic sub-type were included. Associations by type of alcohol consumed (wine, beer and liquor) were also investigated. Alcohol consumption was inversely associated with lung cancer risk with evidence most strongly supporting lower risk for light and moderate drinkers relative to non-drinkers (>0-4.9 g per day: OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.80, 95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.70-0.90; 5-9.9 g per day: OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.82, 95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.69-0.99; 10-19.9 g per day: OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.79, 95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.65-0.96). Inverse associations were found for consumption of wine and liquor, but not beer. The results indicate that alcohol consumption is inversely associated with lung cancer risk, particularly among subjects with low to moderate consumption levels, and among wine and liquor drinkers, but not beer drinkers. Although our results should have no relevant bias from the confounding effect of smoking we cannot preclude that confounding by other factors contributed to the observed associations.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items listed in the text:   This final report of the Lancet Commission into liver disease in the UK stresses the continuing increase in burden of liver disease from excess alcohol consumption and obesity, with high levels of hospital admissions which are worsening in deprived areas. Only with comprehensive food and alcohol strategies based on fiscal and regulatory measures (including a minimum unit price for alcohol, the alcohol duty escalator, and an extension of the sugar levy on food content) can the disease burden be curtailed. Following introduction of minimum unit pricing in Scotland, alcohol sales fell by 3%, with the greatest effect on heavy drinkers of low-cost alcohol products. We also discuss the major contribution of obesity and alcohol to the ten most common cancers as well as measures outlined by the departing Chief Medical Officer to combat rising levels of obesity-the highest of any country in the west. Mortality of severely ill patients with liver disease in district general hospitals is unacceptably high, indicating the need to develop a masterplan for improving hospital care. We propose a plan based around specialist hospital centres that are linked to district general hospitals by operational delivery networks. This plan has received strong backing from the British Association for Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology, but is held up at NHS England. The value of so-called day-case care bundles to reduce high hospital readmission rates with greater care in the community is described, along with examples of locally derived schemes for the early detection of disease and, in particular, schemes to allow general practitioners to refer patients directly for elastography assessment. New funding arrangements for general practitioners will be required if these proposals are to be taken up more widely around the country. Understanding of the harm to health from lifestyle causes among the general population is low, with a poor knowledge of alcohol consumption and dietary guidelines. The Lancet Commission has serious doubts about whether the initiatives described in the Prevention Green Paper, with the onus placed on the individual based on the use of information technology and the latest in behavioural science, will be effective. We call for greater coordination between official and non-official bodies that have highlighted the unacceptable disease burden from liver disease in England in order to present a single, strong voice to the higher echelons of government.

Anhydrous milk fat, viz., ghee, is consumed as such in the diet and also is used for frying the dishes. Ghee contains high levels of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, which are considered risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, ghee, at levels ranging from 0.25 to 10%, was included in a nutritionally balanced AIN-76 diet fed to Wistar rats for a period of 8 weeks. The serum lipid profiles of these animals showed a dose dependent decrease in total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins and very low density lipoproteins cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when ghee was present at levels greater than 2.5% in the diet. Liver cholesterol and triglycerides also were decreased in these animals. When ghee was included as a sole source of fat at a 10% level, polyunsaturated fatty acids in the serum and liver lipids were reduced significantly. Similar results were observed when ghee was subjected to a higher temperature (120 degrees C) to generate cholesterol oxidation products and fed to the animals. Although cholesterol oxidation products were not accumulated in serum, significant amounts were accumulated in liver only when ghee was fed as a sole source of fat at a 10% level. This study revealed that the consumption of ghee up to a 10% level in the diet altered blood lipid profiles in such a manner as not to elevate the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

Each subject consumed each of five reduced-fat diets [30 energy percent (E%) fat, 17 E% protein and 53 E% carbohydrate] enriched in beef tallow, canola oil, corn oil, olive oil or rice bran oil (20 E%) for 32-d periods. In vitro oxidation of LDL was assessed by incubating LDL with hemin and hydrogen peroxide, and measuring the time required for the reaction to reach maximum velocity (lag time). LDL lag times were 93.2 +/- 25.8, 95.9 +/- 26.4, 104.2 +/- 32.7, 108.0 +/- 26.6 and 113.1 +/- 24.0 min for corn oil, beef tallow, rice bran oil, canola oil and olive oil periods, respectively. When the data from all dietary phases were pooled, LDL alpha-tocopherol level (r = 0.30, P = 0.01) and plasma 18:1/18:2 ratio (r = 0.22, P = 0.08) were positively related to resistance of LDL to oxidation. Differences induced by the dietary perturbations in LDL content of beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, alpha-carotene or beta-carotene, and LDL particle size were not related to resistance of LDL to oxidation. In conclusion, in middle-aged and elderly moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects, the consumption of reduced-fat diets enriched in animal fat or vegetable oils with a relatively wide range of fatty acid profiles did not alter the in vitro susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. The advantages of reducing the saturated fat content of the diet were reflected in lower total and LDL cholesterol levels.

Height, weight, and triceps skinfolds were measured. Mean relative weight and relative logarithmic skinfold thickness were close to standard, although 8 per cent of the boys and 9 per cent of the girls weighed more than 120 per cent of standard weight for their age and sex. Weight was closely associated with skinfold thickness. Over two-thirds of both boys and girls believed that daily consumption of milk, bread, fruits, eggs, cheese, meat, and tomatoes is desirable, and about two-thirds stated that overeating is a cause of obesity. More overweight than thin and normal-weight children indicated that, to prevent obesity, all kinds of food are permissible, but only in limited amounts. Most children believed in the fattening value of cakes, sweets, fried and fatty food, potatoes, bread, and nuts. The belief in the fattening value of potatoes, bread, and nuts was shared by a higher percentage of overweight than of under- and normal-weight children. Overweight children, particularly girls, reported eating less bread, cake, and cream, adding less sugar to beverages, and eating sweets and ice cream less frequently than thin and normal-weight children. A higher percentage of the obese group reported skipping one meal and eating no snack at school. Overweight teen-agers appear to be more conscious of their food intake than under- and normal-weight children.

In rats fed the low and high calcium phosphate diets, fecal excretion of fatty acids diminished in the order palm oil > milk fat > corn oil. Palm oil also caused the highest concentration of fatty acids measured in fecal water followed by milk fat and corn oil when fed at both calcium phosphate levels. The differences in concentrations of luminal surfactants in fecal water of rats fed the three fat diets resulted in a fat type-dependent cytotoxicity of fecal water, with that of palm oil-fed rats the most cytotoxic. The concentrations of fatty acids as well as bile acids in fecal water were, however, significantly lowered by calcium phosphate supplementation in rats fed all types of dietary fat. This reduction in concentration of fecal water surfactants resulted in a lower cytotoxicity of fecal water. The concentration of surfactants in fecal water and cytotoxicity were correlated by multiple regression analysis (R = 0.89). Intestinal epitheliolysis measured as alkaline phosphatase activity in fecal water was lowered comparably to the reduction in cytotoxicity by supplemental calcium phosphate. Intestinal epitheliolysis and cytotoxicity of fecal water were correlated (r = 0.92, P < 0.001). The type of dietary fat and the amount of dietary calcium phosphate influence the concentrations of surfactants in fecal water and consequently affect cytotoxicity of fecal water and intestinal epitheliolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  [/INST] Sure thing, the entities regarding food are listed as follows:  dietary fat, palm oil, milk fat, corn oil.

[INST]  Extract all mentions of food from the text:   The health consequences of coffee drinking remain controversial. We report on an association between coffee consumption and the concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for adverse pregnancy outcome. The study population consisted of 7589 men and 8585 women 40-67 y of age and with no history of hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease. They were recruited from Hordaland county of western Norway in 1992-1993. Daily use of coffee was reported by 89.1% of the participants, of whom 94.9% used caffeinated filtered coffee. There was a marked positive dose-response relation between coffee consumption and plasma tHcy, which was stronger than the relation between coffee and total serum cholesterol. In 40-42-y-old men, mean tHcy was 10.1 mumol/L for nonusers and 12.0 mumol/L for drinkers of > or = 9 cups of coffee/d. Corresponding tHcy concentrations in 40-42-y-old women were 8.2 and 10.5 mumol/L, respectively. Although coffee drinking was associated with smoking and lower intake of vitamin supplements and fruit and vegetables, the coffee-tHcy association was only moderately reduced after these variables were adjusted for. The combination of cigarette smoking and high coffee intake was associated with particularly high tHcy concentrations. A strong inverse relation between tea and tHcy concentration in univariate analysis was substantially attenuated after smoking and coffee drinking were adjusted for. The results of the present report should promote future studies on tHcy as a possible mediator of adverse clinical effects related to heavy coffee consumption.

[INST]  Extract all food-related references from the text:   Strategies that decrease postprandial glucose excursions, including digestive enzyme inhibition, and low glycemic index diets result in lower diabetes incidence and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, possibly through lower postprandial oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. We therefore assessed the effect of decreasing postprandial glucose excursions on measures of oxidative damage. Fifteen healthy subjects ate 2 bread control meals and 3 test meals: almonds and bread; parboiled rice; and instant mashed potatoes, balanced in carbohydrate, fat, and protein, using butter and cheese. We obtained blood samples at baseline and for 4 h postprandially. Glycemic indices for the rice (38 +/- 6) and almond meals (55 +/- 7) were less than for the potato meal (94 +/- 11) (P < 0.003), as were the postprandial areas under the insulin concentration time curve (P < 0.001). No postmeal treatment differences were seen in total antioxidant capacity. However, the serum protein thiol concentration increased following the almond meal (15 +/- 14 mmol/L), indicating less oxidative protein damage, and decreased after the control bread, rice, and potato meals (-10 +/- 8 mmol/L), when data from these 3 meals were pooled (P = 0.021). The change in protein thiols was also negatively related to the postprandial incremental peak glucose (r = -0.29, n = 60 observations, P = 0.026) and peak insulin responses (r = -0.26, n = 60 observations, P = 0.046). Therefore, lowering postprandial glucose excursions may decrease the risk of oxidative damage to proteins. Almonds are likely to lower this risk by decreasing the glycemic excursion and by providing antioxidants. These actions may relate to mechanisms by which nuts are associated with a decreased risk of CHD.

Therefore, we hypothesized that consumption of flavonoids and specific food and beverage sources of flavonoids would be associated with reduced risk of incident diabetes. At baseline (1986), diet (by food frequency questionnaire) and health information were collected from 35,816 postmenopausal women free of diabetes. Self-reported incident diabetes was ascertained 5 times during the study (1987, 1989, 1992, 1997, and 2004). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios for incident diabetes according to categories of total flavonoids and anthocyanidins, flavones, flavanones, flavonols, flavan-3-ol monomers, isoflavones, and proanthocyanidins. Hazard ratios according to intake categories of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages were also calculated (apples, pears, berries, broccoli, bran, citrus, tea, and red wine). Flavonoid consumption was not associated with diabetes risk after multivariable adjustment. Although other flavonoid-rich foods and beverages were not associated, red wine was inversely associated with diabetes. Women who reported drinking red wine >or=1 time/wk had a 16% reduced risk of diabetes than those drinking wine <1 time/wk [HR (95% CI): 0.84 (0.71, 0.99)], with parallel findings for white wine, beer, and liquor. In conclusion, these data do not support a diabetes-protective effect of flavonoids. The suggestive evidence of a protective effect of regular red wine consumption is shared with an inverse association between alcohol drinks in general and diabetes risk and may reflect the effects of nonflavonoid constituents that are common to all alcohol drinks.

This study investigated the correlation of dietary patterns with components of dyslipidemia and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) among young and middle-aged adults (aged between 20 and 50 years) with dyslipidemia and abnormal FPG in Taiwan. This cross-sectional study used the database compiled in Taiwan between 2001 to 2010. A total of 13,609 subjects aged between 20 and 50 years were selected. Dyslipidemia was defined primarily according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines with minor modification. Elevated FPG level was defined according to the American Diabetes Association. The factor analysis was conducted to identify three dietary patterns. Higher scores of the meat-convenience dietary pattern (high intake of deep-fried and processed food, sauces, sugar-added beverages, meat and organ meats, instant noodles, rice or flour cooked in oil, and eggs) had no association with components of dyslipidemia and abnormal FPG. Higher scores of the vegetables-fruits-seafood dietary pattern (high intake of vegetables, vegetables with oil or dressing, fruits, seafood, legumes, soy products, and rice or flour products) was inversely associated with hypercholesterolemia and positively associated with hyperglycemia. Higher scores of the dairy-complex carbohydrate dietary pattern (high intake of dairy products, milk, root crops, jam or honey, and whole grains) was inversely correlated with hypertriglycemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.

[INST]  Extract all food-related mentions from the text:   Studies on the effects of garlic (Allium sativum) on hyperlipidemia have demonstrated somewhat controversial results and there have been few studies on its enzymatic mechanism. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of garlic on the liver phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) activity, plasma lipid levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) and plasma antioxidant in rats fed either by normal or high-lipogenic diet with or without garlic. Male Wistar rats were fed by standard pellet diet (group I), standard diet supplemented with 4% garlic (group II), lipogenic diet (containing sunflower oil, cholesterol and ethanol) plus 4% garlic (group III) and only lipogenic diet (group IV). Results showed that garlic significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), plasma triglyceride (TG), LDL-C, VLDL-C, liver triglyceride, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and elevated plasma antioxidant in garlic treated rats (groups II and III) compared to group IV (lipogenic diet group). Also, liver PAP activity was decreased in group II than group I whereas, the decrease in its activity in groups III and IV was due to the accumulation of triglyceride in liver. Therefore, the results are clearly indicative of the beneficial effects of garlic in reducing lateral side effects of hyperlipidemia.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities within the text:   A multi-centre case-control study of diet and gastric cancer was carried out in 4 regions of Spain (Aragon, Castile, Catalonia and Galicia). We selected 354 cases of pathologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma from 15 hospitals, representative of nearly all those in the study areas. A control for each case, matched by age, sex and area of residence, was selected from the same hospital as the case. Habitual diet was investigated by the dietary history method, and past diet by means of a frequency questionnaire. The results regarding consumption of food items are presented here. With respect to habitual diet, an increase in risk was associated with consumption of preserved fish, cold cuts and oleaginous fruits. A high intake of cooked green vegetables, fresh noncitrus fruit and dried fruit showed an inverse association with the risk of gastric cancer. Simultaneous intake of 2 groups of food which increase or decrease the risk of cancer strengthens the respective individual effect. The intake of protective food items seems to neutralize the effects of food items which increase risk. With reference to past diet, a possible protective effect was observed for daily consumption of fresh fruit and green vegetables.

A dietary food pattern naturally rich in polyphenols is the Mediterranean diet and evidence suggests those of Mediterranean descent have a lower breast cancer incidence. Whilst dietary polyphenols have been the subject of breast cancer risk-reduction, this review will focus on the clinical effects of polyphenols on reducing recurrence. Overall, we recommend breast cancer patients consume a diet naturally high in flavonol polyphenols including tea, vegetables (onion, broccoli), and fruit (apples, citrus). At least five servings of vegetables and fruit daily appear protective. Moderate soy protein consumption (5-10 g daily) and the Mediterranean dietary pattern show the most promise for breast cancer patients. In this review, we present an overview of clinical trials on supplementary polyphenols of dietary patterns rich in polyphenols on breast cancer recurrence, mechanistic data, and novel delivery systems currently being researched.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables containing high levels of phytochemicals has been recommended to prevent chronic diseases related to oxidative stress in the human body. In this study, 10 common vegetables were selected on the basis of consumption per capita data in the United States. A more complete profile of phenolic distributions, including both free and bound phenolics in these vegetables, is reported here using new and modified methods. Broccoli possessed the highest total phenolic content, followed by spinach, yellow onion, red pepper, carrot, cabbage, potato, lettuce, celery, and cucumber. Red pepper had the highest total antioxidant activity, followed by broccoli, carrot, spinach, cabbage, yellow onion, celery, potato, lettuce, and cucumber. The phenolics antioxidant index (PAI) was proposed to evaluate the quality/quantity of phenolic contents in these vegetables and was calculated from the corrected total antioxidant activities by eliminating vitamin C contributions. Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human liver cancer cells. Spinach showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by cabbage, red pepper, onion, and broccoli. On the basis of these results, the bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a simple reference for consumers to choose vegetables in accordance with their beneficial activities. The BI could be a new alternative biomarker for future epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.

[INST]  Retrieve all food entities contained in the text:   Background Arsenic-related cardiovascular effects at exposure levels below the US Environmental Protection Agency's standard of 10<U+00A0><U+03BC>g/L are unclear. For these populations, food, especially rice, is a major source of exposure. We investigated associations of rice intake, a marker of arsenic exposure, with subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers in a multiethnic population. Methods and Results Between 2000 and 2002, MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) enrolled 6814 adults without clinical CVD. We included 5050 participants with baseline data on rice intake and markers of 3 CVD domains: inflammation (hsCRP [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein], interleukin-6, and fibrinogen), vascular function (aortic distensibility, carotid distensibility, and brachial flow-mediated dilation), and subclinical atherosclerosis at 3 vascular sites (carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcification, and ankle-brachial index). We also evaluated endothelial-related biomarkers previously associated with arsenic. Rice intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Urinary arsenic was measured in 310 participants. A total of 13% of participants consumed <U+2265>1<U+00A0>serving of rice/day. Compared with individuals consuming <1<U+00A0>serving of rice/week, <U+2265>1<U+00A0>serving of rice/day was not associated with subclinical markers after demographic, lifestyle, and CVD risk factor adjustment (eg, geometric mean ratio [95% CI] for hsCRP, 0.98 [0.86-1.11]; aortic distensibility, 0.99 [0.91-1.07]; and carotid intima-media thickness, 0.98 [0.91-1.06]). Associations with urinary arsenic were similar to those for rice intake. Conclusions Rice intake was not associated with subclinical CVD markers in a multiethnic US population. Research using urinary arsenic is needed to assess potential CVD effects of low-level arsenic exposure. Understanding the role of low-level arsenic as it relates to subclinical CVD may contribute to CVD prevention and control.

[INST]  Identify all food items referenced in the text:   A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and minimally refined cereals is associated with lower risk for chronic degenerative diseases. Since oxidative stress is common in chronic degenerative disease, it has been assumed that dietary antioxidants may explain this protective effect. Every dietary plant contains numerous types of antioxidants with different properties. Many of these antioxidants cooperate in oxidative stress reduction in plants, and we hypothesize that many different antioxidants may also be needed for the proper protection of animal cells. To test this hypothesis, it is useful to identify dietary plants with high total antioxidant content. Several nuts are among the dietary plants with the highest content of total antioxidants. Of the tree nuts, walnuts, pecans and chestnuts have the highest contents of antioxidants. Walnuts contain more than 20 mmol antioxidants per 100 g, mostly in the walnut pellicles. Peanuts (a legume) also contribute significantly to dietary intake of antioxidants. These data are in accordance with our present extended analysis of an earlier report on nut intake and death attributed to various diseases in the Iowa Women's Health Study. We observed that the hazard ratio for total death rates showed a U-shaped association with nut/peanut butter consumption. Hazard ratio was 0.89 (CI = 0.81-0.97) and 0.81 (CI = 0.75-0.88) for nut/peanut butter intake once per week and 1-4 times per week, respectively. Death attributed to cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases showed strong and consistent reductions with increasing nut/peanut butter consumption. Further studies are needed to clarify whether antioxidants contribute to this apparent beneficial health effect of nuts.

Among major food groups, milk and dairy products as well as added lipids were marginally positively associated with risk for prostate cancer. Among added lipids, seed oils were significantly and butter and margarine non-significantly positively associated with prostate cancer risk, whereas olive oil was unrelated to this risk. Cooked tomatoes and to a lesser extent raw tomatoes were inversely associated with the risk for prostate cancer.

The commonest foods causing reactions were wheat (78%), orange (65%), eggs (45%), tea and coffee (40% each), chocolate and milk (37%) each), beef (35%), and corn, cane sugar, and yeast (33% each). When an average of ten common foods were avoided there was a dramatic fall in the number of headaches per month, 85% of patients becoming headache-free.

[INST]  Find all food-related entities mentioned in the text:   We describe a 27-year-old subject who developed rhinitis and asthma symptoms 1 year after starting to prepare a certain kind of sausage. He was previously diagnosed as having allergy to coconut, banana, and kiwi and allergic rhinitis to horse, cat, dog, and cow. A positive immediate skin prick test (SPT) for paprika (dry powder of Capsicum annuum [Solanaceae]), coriander (Coriandrum sativum [umbelliferous]), and mace (shell of nutmeg, Myristica fragrans [Myristicaceae]) at a concentration of 10% (w/v) was obtained. SPT with other sausage ingredients, mites, pollens, and molds were negative. By ELISA, specific IgE antibodies to paprika, coriander, and mace were demonstrated. By ELISA-inhibition assays, a partial cross-reactivity was found among IgE-binding components from paprika and mace. The immunoblot analysis showed two IgE-reactive protein bands able to bind to IgE from mace of 20 and 40 kDa and two other bands from coriander extract of 50 and 56 kDa. No bands were detected from paprika extract. Specific bronchial inhalation challenges showed an immediate asthmatic reaction to extracts from paprika, coriander, and mace with a maximum fall in FEV1 of 26%, 40%, and 31%, respectively, with no late asthmatic reactions. In summary, we demonstrate that inhalation of dust from paprika, coriander, and mace can result in an IgE-mediated reaction to these spices. In this patient, occupational asthma was due to spices from botanically unrelated species.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items referenced in the text:   High intake of red meat or processed meat is associated with increased risk of colon cancer. In contrast, consumption of white meat (chicken) is not associated with risk and might even reduce the occurrence of colorectal cancer. We speculated that a diet containing beef or bacon would increase and a diet containing chicken would decrease colon carcinogenesis in rats. One hundred female Fischer 344 rats were given a single injection of azoxymethane (20 mg/kg i.p.), then randomized to 10 different AIN-76-based diets. Five diets were adjusted to 14% fat and 23% protein and five other diets to 28% fat and 40% protein. Fat and protein were supplied by 1) lard and casein, 2) olive oil and casein, 3) beef, 4) chicken with skin, and 5) bacon. Meat diets contained 30% or 60% freeze-dried fried meat. The diets were given ad libitum for 100 days, then colon tumor promotion was assessed by the multiplicity of aberrant crypt foci [number of crypts per aberrant crypt focus (ACF)]. The ACF multiplicity was nearly the same in all groups, except bacon-fed rats, with no effect of fat and protein level or source (p = 0.7 between 8 groups by analysis of variance). In contrast, compared with lard- and casein-fed controls, the ACF multiplicity was reduced by 12% in rats fed a diet with 30% bacon and by 20% in rats fed a diet with 60% bacon (p < 0.001). The water intake was higher in bacon-fed rats than in controls (p < 0.0001). The concentrations of iron and bile acids in fecal water and total fatty acids in feces changed with diet, but there was no correlation between these concentrations and the ACF multiplicity. Thus the hypothesis that colonic iron, bile acids, or total fatty acids can promote colon tumors is not supported by this study. The results suggest that, in rats, beef does not promote the growth of ACF and chicken does not protect against colon carcinogenesis. A bacon-based diet appears to protect against carcinogenesis, perhaps because bacon contains 5% NaCl and increased the rats' water intake.

Domestic use of kefir is straightforward and the eggshell is a natural discarded source of Ca. This paper proposes the development of an enriched Ca reduced lactose milk using eggshell and kefir. During the in vitro preparation, the pH, Ca and lactose contents were measured. Ca intestinal absorption of untreated milk and milk with kefir was compared. Finally, human volunteers consumed this dairy product and 24-h urine Ca was measured. Results showed that the beverage has lower lactose and higher Ca than untreated milk and milk with kefir. Intestinal Ca absorption was not different between both milks and an increase in urinary Ca excretion was observed in humans. This study provides a methodology to prepare at home a dairy product that could contribute to improve the Ca intake in adults.

We assessed the relation between food consumption and the risk of cutaneous melanoma in a Northern Italy population. We carried out a population-based case-control study involving 380 cases of melanoma and 719 age- and sex-matched controls. Dietary habits were established through a self-administered semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We computed the odds ratios (ORs) of melanoma and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to tertiles of daily intake of each food item, using multiple logistic regression models adjusted for major confounding factors. We observed an indication of a positive association between melanoma risk and consumption of cereals and cereal products (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 0.89-1.96, higher vs. lowest tertile), sweets (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 0.84-1.76), chocolate, candy bars. etc., (OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.09-2.09) and cabbages (OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.09-2.09). Conversely, an inverse association with disease risk was found for the intake of legumes (OR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.52-1.13), olive oil (OR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.51-1.16), eggs (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.41-0.82), and onion and garlic (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.52-1.14). No relationship was observed with beverage consumption. Our results suggest potentially adverse effects on melanoma risk of foods characterized by high contents of refined flours and sugars, while suggesting a protective role for eggs and two key components of the Mediterranean diet, legumes and olive oil. These associations warrant further investigation and, if confirmed, they might have important public health implications for the reduction of melanoma incidence through dietary modification.

This glycolipids fraction was an inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) in vitro and also the proliferation of human cancer cells. In this study, eight common vegetables were investigated in terms of the glycolipids fraction, the amounts of major glycolipids, mammalian DNA polymerase inhibitory activity and antiproliferative activity toward human cancer cells. Green tea possessed the largest amount of glycolipids overall. Spinach contained the largest amount of SQDG, followed by parsley, green onion, chive, sweet pepper, green tea, carrot and garlic. Spinach had the strongest inhibitory effect on pol alpha activity and human cancer cell proliferation. A significant correlation was found between SQDG content and inhibition of DNA polymerase. Therefore, the inhibition of pol alpha activity by SQDG may lead to cell growth suppression. Of the six subspecies of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) tested, "Anna" had the largest amount of SQDG, strongest inhibitory activity toward DNA polymerase and greatest effect on human cancer cell proliferation. Based on these results, the glycolipids fraction from spinach is potentially a source of food material for a novel anticancer activity.

Regular consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with reduced risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, Alzheimer disease, cataracts, and some of the functional declines associated with aging. Prevention is a more effective strategy than is treatment of chronic diseases. Functional foods that contain significant amounts of bioactive components may provide desirable health benefits beyond basic nutrition and play important roles in the prevention of chronic diseases. The key question is whether a purified phytochemical has the same health benefit as does the whole food or mixture of foods in which the phytochemical is present. Our group found, for example, that the vitamin C in apples with skin accounts for only 0.4% of the total antioxidant activity, suggesting that most of the antioxidant activity of fruit and vegetables may come from phenolics and flavonoids in apples. We propose that the additive and synergistic effects of phytochemicals in fruit and vegetables are responsible for their potent antioxidant and anticancer activities, and that the benefit of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables is attributed to the complex mixture of phytochemicals present in whole foods.

Other contributions have included the value of nut consumption for prevention of coronary artery disease, and the roles of red meat and dairy products in the etiologies of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Although much progress has been made, many issues remain unresolved. In particular, rates of breast and prostate cancers remain high among Adventist populations despite an overall healthy lifestyle and long life expectancy. There is even some suggestion that risk of breast cancer may increase with duration of being a vegetarian. One topic that may be uniquely studied among an Adventist population is the effect of soy phytoestrogens in disease prevention. Although soy consumption has been hypothesized to contribute to the low rates of breast cancer in Asian populations, several intervention studies using high doses of soy estrogens have shown changes in breast nipple fluid that would predict higher rates of breast cancer. Also, high dairy product consumption has been associated with risk of prostate and ovarian cancers in some but not all studies. The unusually wide range of milk consumption in Adventists will be particularly informative with regard to these relations. Resolution of these issues is needed to provide optimal guidance regarding healthy diets, and the newly funded Adventist Health Study will contribute importantly in this effort.

We examined the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition's double pyramid to describe the carbon, water, and ecological footprints of the components of a cardio-protective diet. Overall, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains all tend to have low carbon and water footprints, while nuts and olive oil have relatively higher water footprints and fish have a high ecological footprint. In order to increase the sustainability of a cardio-protective diet, consumers can choose nuts (e.g., walnuts) and oils (e.g., sunflower) with lower water footprints and sustainably produced fish. However, in order to increase consumption of these foods, parallel efforts should be implemented targeting consumer knowledge and incentives to make these foods more affordable.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Detailed knowledge of food oxalate content is of essential importance for dietary treatment of recurrent calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Dietary oxalate can contribute considerably to the amount of urinary oxalate excretion. Because cereal foods play an important role in daily nutrition, the soluble and total oxalate contents of various types of cereal grains, milling products, bread, pastries, and pasta were analyzed using an HPLC-enzyme-reactor method. A high total oxalate content (>50 mg/100 g) was found in whole grain wheat species Triticum durum (76.6 mg/100 g), Triticum sativum (71.2 mg/100 g), and Triticum aestivum (53.3 mg/100 g). Total oxalate content was comparably high in whole grain products of T. aestivum, that is, wheat flakes and flour, as well as in whole grain products of T. durum, that is, couscous, bulgur, and pasta. The highest oxalate content was demonstrated for wheat bran (457.4 mg/100 g). The higher oxalate content in whole grain than in refined grain cereals suggests that oxalic acid is primarily located in the outer layers of cereal grains. Cereals and cereal products contribute to the daily oxalate intake to a considerable extent. Vegetarian diets may contain high amounts of oxalate when whole grain wheat and wheat products are ingested. Recommendations for prevention of recurrence of calcium oxalate stone disease have to take into account the oxalate content of these foodstuffs.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms present in the text:   Epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of tea flavonoids may be associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer-related deaths. The flavonoids are polyphenols which in vitro exhibit antioxidant properties. Tea flavonoids are known to be rapidly absorbed into the circulation following oral ingestion. To date few studies have demonstrated that these bioavailable flavonoids retain antioxidant properties in vivo. Nine healthy subjects aged between 26 and 59 (one male and eight females) took part in 3 study days. On 1 day subjects consumed no tea and on the other 2 days subjects drank either black tea with milk, or black tea alone at hourly intervals between 9.00 a.m. and 14.00 p.m. Blood was sampled at 9.00 a.m. and at 12.00 p.m. and 15.00 p.m. The antioxidant potential of plasma was determined using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Subjects consuming no tea exhibited no significant change in FRAP across the 6 hours of the study day. Similarly consumption of milky tea produced no change in FRAP between 9.00 a.m. and 12.00 p.m. and the 50% increase in FRAP noted between 12.00 p.m. and 15.00 p.m. was not statistically significant. When the subjects consumed black tea without milk FRAP increased by 65% between 9.00 a.m. and 12.00 p.m. (P = 0.02) and at 15.00 p.m. was 76% higher than at 9.00 a.m. (P = 0.002). Heavy consumption of black tea thus appears to elevate circulating antioxidant potentials in vivo. This is an effect which appears to be totally negated by the drinking of tea with milk. Although tea may thus represent an important source of dietary antioxidants in many societies, the role of tea in reducing risk of major disease states needs to be investigated in more detail.

Among traditional treatments, dietary habits represent one of the most difficult and controversial aspects to implement in handling metabolic disturbances. The use of herbal remedies by latinos and hispanics, as part of self-care of metabolic diseases has been well documented in several studies, mainly because they are "natural", consistent with their culture, family-related, accessible, and affordable. Phytochemicals are present in fruits, vegetables and various plants, and constitute nonessential nutrients such as vitamins or minerals, many of them being consumed in a popular way or used as herbal remedies or dietary supplements.

We examined prospective associations between dietary patterns and the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in 3226 older British men, aged 60-79 years and free from CVD at baseline, from the British Regional Heart Study. Baseline FFQ data were used to generate thirty-four food groups. Principal component analysis identified dietary patterns that were categorised into quartiles, with higher quartiles representing higher adherence to the dietary pattern. Cox proportional hazards examined associations between dietary patterns and risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. We identified three interpretable dietary patterns: 'high fat/low fibre' (high in red meat, meat products, white bread, fried potato, eggs), 'prudent' (high in poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes, pasta, rice, wholemeal bread, eggs, olive oil) and 'high sugar' (high in biscuits, puddings, chocolates, sweets, sweet spreads, breakfast cereals). During 11 years of follow-up, 899 deaths, 316 CVD-related deaths, 569 CVD events and 301 CHD events occurred. The 'high-fat/low-fibre' dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality only, after adjustment for confounders (highest v. lowest quartile; hazard ratio 1<U+00B7>44; 95 % CI 1<U+00B7>13, 1<U+00B7>84). Adherence to a 'high-sugar' diet was associated with a borderline significant trend for an increased risk of CVD and CHD events. The 'prudent' diet did not show a significant trend with cardiovascular outcomes or mortality. Avoiding 'high-fat/low-fibre' and 'high-sugar' dietary components may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in older adults.

[INST]  Extract all mentions of food from the text:   Test meals with 25 g protein in the form of cottage cheese or egg white were given with or without 50 g glucose to male subjects with mild to moderately severe, untreated, type II diabetes. Water was given as a control meal. The glucose, insulin, C-peptide, alpha amino nitrogen (AAN), glucagon, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and triglyceride area responses were determined using the water meal as a baseline. The glucose area responses following ingestion of cottage cheese or egg white were very small compared with those of the glucose meal, and were not significantly different from one another. The serum insulin area response was 3.6-fold greater following ingestion of cottage cheese compared with egg white (309 v 86 pmol/L.h). The simultaneous ingestion of glucose with cottage cheese or egg white protein decreased the glucose area response to glucose by 11% and 20%, respectively. When either protein was ingested with glucose, the insulin area response was greater than the sum of the individual responses, indicating a synergistic effect (glucose alone, 732 pmol/L.h; glucose with cottage cheese, 1,637 pmol/L.h; glucose with egg white, 1,213 pmol/L.h). The C-peptide area response was similar to the insulin area response. The AAN area response was approximately twofold greater following ingestion of cottage cheese compared with egg white. Following ingestion of glucose, it was negative. When protein was ingested with glucose, the AAN area responses were additive. The glucagon area response was similar following ingestion of cottage cheese or egg white protein.

[INST]  Extract all references to food items from the text:   An increasing number of reports suggest that diet has an impact on oesophageal cancer risk in Western countries, where alcohol and tobacco are held to be the major determinants of the risk. The aim of our study was to identify dietary factors influencing the risk of oesophageal cancer in France and to determine whether certain of these could explain some of the geographical variations. We conducted a multicentre case-control study in 3 regions expected to have different diet and drinking habits (Normandy, Burgundy and Midi Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es). Two hundred eight cases and 399 controls, all males, were interviewed about their eating, drinking and smoking habits. After proper adjustment for drinking and smoking, high consumption of butter and low consumption of fresh fish, vegetables and fruits were associated strongly and independently with an increase in oesophageal-cancer risk. Consistently, cholesterol appeared as a risk factor and vitamin E, vitamin D and phosphorus as independent protective factors. The protective effect of citrus and other fresh fruits (vitamin C) was confined strictly to heavy drinkers. Our findings suggest that more than one-third of the high incidence of oesophageal cancer in northwest France could be explained by the local excess in butter consumption, whereas geographical variations in consumption of dietary protective factors could explain no more than 10% of it. Overall, a large proportion (57%) of the excess incidence of oesophageal cancer in northwest France could be explained by local dietary habits, e.g., drinking hot Calvados liquor and excessive consumption of butter.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food-related terms in the text:   Reducing the amount of sodium in food products is necessary in decreasing the prevalence of hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. There is a lack of information on sodium reduction in potato chips and puffed rice, which comprise a large percentage of salty snack sales, and the use of flavor enhancers to maintain consumer acceptability of these products. The objective of this study was to identify drivers of liking for potato chip and puffed rice samples seasoned with differing sodium and flavor enhancer concentrations using sensory descriptive analysis and acceptance data. Eleven trained panelists evaluated the snacks and found eight significantly different attributes for potato chips and seven significantly different attributes for puffed rice. To better understand how these differences in samples play a role in sample liking, the descriptive analysis data were correlated with the data from a consumer test through preference mapping. For potato chips, consumers liked samples characterized by meaty aftertaste, aroma, aroma-by-mouth, and umami aftertaste. Consumers disliked samples with a strong raw potato aroma. For puffed rice, consumers liked samples with attributes of crunchy texture, garlic aftertaste, and savory aftertaste and disliked bitter aftertaste and chili powder aroma-by-mouth. These findings imply acceptance of sodium-reduced potato chips and puffed rice is possible by focusing on these identified drivers of liking. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Our findings suggest the addition of flavor enhancers maintains or improves the palatability of reduced sodium products with eight attributes influencing liking of potato chips and seven attributes influencing liking of puffed rice. Understanding the sensory attributes that impact the acceptance of reduced sodium products will allow for these attributes to be the focus during product development, which may result in increased sales of reduced sodium snacks, thus decreasing sodium consumption from snack products.

[INST]  Extract all references to food items from the text:   Previous reports have documented the fact that plasma glucose and insulin responses can vary in response to the ingestion of different carbohydrate-rich foods. This has led to the creation of a "glycemic index," a classification of dietary carbohydrates on the basis of the relative rise in plasma glucose after the administration of the food in question as compared to a standard glucose challenge. In order to test the clinical utility of these observations, we evaluated plasma glucose, insulin, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses to four major sources of carbohydrate (potato, rice, spaghetti, lentil) as part of a conventional mixed meal in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Each test meal provided 40% of the subjects' calculated caloric requirement and contained 15% of total calories as protein, 40% as fat, and 45% as carbohydrate. The test carbohydrate represented 66% of total carbohydrate. The results indicated that plasma glucose concentrations after meals containing equal amounts of carbohydrate as rice, spaghetti, or lentil were similar and somewhat lower than meals containing potato. The plasma insulin responses to the four carbohydrate foods paralleled the glucose responses. Changes in gastric inhibitory polypeptide levels did not account for the effect of potato. These results are totally disparate from what would have been predicted by previously published values for the "glycemic index" of the four foods studied, and suggest that a "glycemic index" based on isolated challenges would have minimal clinical utility in efforts aimed at reducing postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

The Mediterranean dietary pattern is an example of a prudent choice of lifestyle and scientifically accepted to help preserve human health by protecting against major chronic and inflammatory diseases. Mediterranean diets (MedDiets) are characteristically high in the consumption of fruits, vegetables and salad, bread and whole grain cereals, potatoes, legumes/beans, nuts, and seeds. Their common central feature is the usage of olive oil as the main source of fat. The health benefits attributed to olive oil are specifically related to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake with its high nutritional quality and multiple positive effects on health. Overall, MedDiets have direct (mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), tocopherols, polyphenols) and indirect (low saturated fats, well-balanced linoleic/alpha linolenic acid) effects on the immune system and inflammatory responses. In the present paper, we summarize the current knowledge on the effect of olive oil per se and MedDiets generally on immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD)/cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, type-2 diabetes, cancer, asthma, and allergies.

In total, 324 quarters from 82 Holstein Friesian heifers from 3 commercial dairy herds equipped with an automatic milking system were included and followed from calving up to 4 mo in lactation. The automatic milking system allowed us to precisely determine the daily qMY. A milk sample from each quarter was collected in early lactation (between 1 and 4 d in milk) for bacteriological culturing and measurement of the qSCC. Subsequently, milk samples were taken on a biweekly basis for measurement of the qSCC. The milk prolactin level in early lactation was measured, and the relation with NAS IMI was determined. Overall, NAS IMI in early lactation caused only a slight but significant increase in qSCC compared with milk from noninfected quarters during the first 4 mo in lactation, whereas no significant difference in daily qMY was present between NAS-infected and noninfected quarters. The milk prolactin level in early lactation did not differ between NAS-infected and noninfected quarters either. Our data suggest that IMI with NAS (as a group) present shortly after calving do not have an adverse effect on later production. The milk prolactin concentrations were not dissimilar between NAS-infected and noninfected quarters and thus cannot explain why NAS-infected quarters do not produce less than noninfected quarters.

The cardiovascular effects of the nonlipid portion of peanuts has not been evaluated even though that fraction contains arginine, flavonoids, folates, and other compounds that have been linked to cardiovascular health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of fat free peanut flour (FFPF), peanuts, and peanut oil on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis in male Syrian golden hamsters. Each experimental diet group was fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet with various peanut components (FFPF, peanut oil, or peanuts) substituted for similar metabolic components in the control diet. Tissues were collected at week 0, 12, 18, and 24. Total plasma cholesterol (TPC), LDL-C, and HDL-C distributions were determined by high-performance gel filtration chromatography, while aortic total cholesterol (TC) and cholesteryl ester (CE) were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Peanuts, peanut oil, and FFPF diet groups had significantly (P < 0.05) lower TPC, non-HDL-C than the control group beginning at about 12 wk and continuing through the 24-wk study. HDL-C was not significantly different among the diet groups. Peanut and peanut component diets retarded an increase in TC and CE. Because CE is an indicator of the development of atherosclerosis this study demonstrated that peanuts, peanut oil, and FFPF retarded the development of atherosclerosis in animals consuming an atherosclerosis inducing diet.

[INST]  Extract all food-related terms listed in the text:   High salt intake increases blood pressure, and dietary salt intake has been clearly demonstrated to be associated with hypertension incidence. Japanese people consume higher amounts of salt than Westerners. It has been reported that miso soup was one of the major sources of daily salt intake in Japanese people. Adding salt is indispensable to make miso, and therefore, in some cases, refraining from miso soup is recommended to reduce dietary salt intake. However, recent studies using salt-sensitive hypertensive models have revealed that miso lessens the effects of salt on blood pressure. In other word, the intake of miso dose not increase the blood pressure compared to the equivalent intake of salt. In addition, many clinical observational studies have demonstrated the absence of a relationship between the frequency of miso soup intake and blood pressure levels or hypertension incidence. The mechanism of this phenomenon seen in the subjects with miso soup intake has not been fully elucidated yet. However, in basic studies, it was found that the ingredients of miso attenuate sympathetic nerve activity, resulting in lowered blood pressure and heart rate. Therefore, this review focused on the differences between the effects of miso intake and those of the equivalent salt intake on sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure, and heart rate.

The induction of these protective enzymes appears to be mediated by genetic regulatory elements in their promoter regions known as the antioxidant response element (ARE). The aim of this study was to identify, through an in vitro study, which of the 30 fruits and vegetables commonly consumed in Catalonia, Spain, contain MIs of NQO1. We assayed the capacity of extracts of these fruits and vegetables to induce NQO1 [by more than 1.5-fold: ratio of induction (cells treated/control) >1.5, 8-mg/ml dose] in two murine hepatoma cell lines: Hepa 1c1c7 and BPrC1, a modified cell line that possesses a nonfunctional aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator system and is thus nonresponsive to bifunctional inducers. We also used a third cell line, papiloma (PE) murine keratinocytes, a stably transfected cell line with an ARE-luc+ plasmid (AREPE cell line) for verifying induction through the ARE with a simple luminescence screening assay. Broccoli (Hepa 1c1c7, ratio=5.5; BPrC1, ratio=2.3), calcot (Allium cepa L.) (Hepa 1c1c7, ratio=4.7; BPrC1, ratio=.5), green onion (Hepa 1c1c7, ratio=4.6; BPrC1, ratio=2), green cabbage (Hepa 1c1c7, ratio=3.6; BPrC1, ratio=2.7), purple cabbage (Hepa 1c1c7, ratio=3.4; BPrC1, ratio=2), and black cabbage (Hepa 1c1c7, ratio=3; BPrC1, ratio=3) were active NQO1 inducers in both murine hepatoma cell lines. Extracts from broccoli (ratio=3.5), calcot (ratio=4.8), cauliflower (ratio=4.2), cabbage (ratio=2.2), green onion (ratio=3.2), green cabbage (ratio=3.6), black cabbage (ratio=4.5), and purple cabbage (ratio=3.7) were confirmed to contain MIs in the AREPE cell line.

[INST]  Locate all food items present in the text:   This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between dietary patterns and body mass index among 514 women with different ethnic backgrounds who completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire. An exploratory factor analysis with orthogonal rotation started with 23 food items and resulted in four factors that accounted for 93% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis with the 16 items that had factor loadings of at least 0.60 validated the four dietary patterns. The most significant dietary pattern, "meat," was characterized by high intake of processed and red meats, fish, poultry, eggs, fats and oils, and condiments. The "vegetable" pattern loaded high on different vegetables, whereas the third pattern named "bean" was high in legumes, tofu and soy protein. The major components of the "cold foods" pattern were fruit, fruit juice and cold breakfast cereals. Although the "meat" pattern was predominant among Hawaiians and the "bean" pattern very common among Chinese and Japanese women, factors two and four were not related to ethnicity. After adjustment for daily energy intake, the "meat" pattern was positively associated with body mass index (r = 0.17, P: = 0.0001), whereas the other three patterns showed negative relationships to body mass index (r = -0.076, P: = 0.084, r = -0.13, P: = 0.003, and r = -0.13, P: = 0.003) for vegetables, beans and cold foods, respectively. The associations were similar in direction and magnitude for all ethnic groups. The study results support the ideas that choosing the right foods may be important in weight control and that food-based dietary patterns may be useful in dietary counseling.

[INST]  Retrieve all food entities mentioned in the text:   Wheat (Triticum spp. L.), rye (Secale cereal L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seeds contain peptides toxic to celiac patients. Maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) are distant relatives of wheat as well as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and are known to be safe for celiacs. Both immunochemical studies and in vitro and in vivo challenge of wheat-free sorghum food products support this conclusion, although molecular evidence is missing. The goal of the present study was to provide biochemical and genetic evidence that sorghum is safe for celiac patients. In silico analysis of the recently published sorghum genome predicts that sorghum does not contain peptides that are toxic for celiac patients. Aqueous/alcohol-soluble prolamins (kafirins) from different sorghum varieties, including pure lines and hybrids, were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and HPLC analyses as well as an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the R5 antibody. These analyses provide molecular evidence for the absence of toxic gliadin-like peptides in sorghum, confirming that sorghum can be definitively considered safe for consumption by people with celiac disease.

[INST]  Identify all references to food present in the text:   The effect of four species of legume seeds on plasma cholesterol levels and faecal steroid excretion was studied in pigs. Thirty-six growing boars were randomly allocated in groups of six to six diets which they ate continuously for 42 d. The diets fed were: 1, a semi-purified (SP; control group 1) diet; 2, SP + 10 g cholesterol/kg (control group 2); 3, 4, 5, 6, SP + cooked legumes (70:30, w/w; respectively baked beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), peas (Pisum sativum), lentils (Lens culinaris Medik.), butter beans (Phaseolus lunatus)) + 10 g cholesterol/kg. Fasting blood samples were taken on days 0, 14, 28, and 42 for the determination of total plasma cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triacylglycerols. Between days 7 and 11 and days 28 and 32 complete 5 d faecal collections were made for the measurement of neutral, acidic and conjugated steroids. After 42 d total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels were raised significantly in all groups, but to different extents. In comparison with control group 2, diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia was significantly inhibited in the groups consuming baked beans, peas and butter beans, although HDL-cholesterol levels were maintained. Faecal steroid excretion by the legume groups was not significantly different from that of control group 2. The results suggest that the mechanism for the hypocholesterolaemic effect does not involve increased hepatic bile acid synthesis and thereby increased cholesterol clearance via the intestinal route.

[INST]  Extract all food entities listed in the text:   Since January 2000 the Chilean Ministry of Health has required the fortification of wheat flour with folic acid (FA) at a concentration of 2.2 mg FA/kg in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTD) in newborns. This policy was expected to result in a mean additional intake of approximately 400 microg FA/d. We assessed the effectiveness of the FA flour fortification program on bread folate content and on blood folate concentration in women of childbearing age in Santiago, Chile. The prefortification folate status of 751 healthy women of reproductive age was assessed. The folate content of 100 bread samples bought at retail bakeries was measured, average wheat flour consumption was estimated and postfortification FA dietary intake was calculated. The effect of flour fortification on blood folate concentration in this group of women (n = 605) was evaluated in a follow-up study. Blood folate concentrations of the 605 women in the follow-up group increased (P < 0.0001) following fortification. Before fortification the mean serum and red blood cell folate concentrations were 9.7 +/- 4.3 and 290 +/- 102 nmol/L, respectively, compared with 37.2 +/- 9.5 and 707 +/- 179 nmol/L postfortification, respectively. The mean FA content of bread was 2020 +/- 940 micro g/kg. The median FA intake of the group evaluated postfortification was 427 microg/d (95% CI 409-445) based on an estimated intake of 219 g/d (95% CI 201-229) of wheat flour, mainly as bread. Fortification of wheat flour substantially improved folate status in a population of women of reproductive age in Chile. The effect of the FA fortification program on the occurrence of NTD is currently being assessed.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms found in the text:   This manuscript provides a brief synopsis of 30 studies aimed at examining tea consumption as a factor in the incidence of colon and rectal cancers. The 30 papers examine populations in 12 countries and provide data on consumption of both black and green tea. These studies do not provide consistent evidence to support the theory from animal studies and basic research that tea is a potent chemopreventive agent. Details of the studies are presented, and the potential impact of measurement error, publication bias, the form of tea consumed, the appropriateness of the outcomes studied and the adjustment of confounders related to both tea consumption and risk of colorectal cancer or polyps in various countries are explored. In general, the data are not more consistent for green than for black tea. Particularly with green tea, the doses consumed do get into a perceived protective range in a significant subset of the population. A negative association is stronger in observational epidemiologic studies of rectal cancer than in colon cancer. There is no consistent adjustment for important potential confounders of any tea relationship, such as coffee and alcohol consumption and physical activity levels. Finally, the assessment of tea in most of these studies was based on a single question and therefore may have significant measurement error compared with more recent studies specifically aimed at assessing tea consumption.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related entities mentioned in the text:   The Mediterranean diet is a healthy eating pattern with protective effects on chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the relation between BMI and obesity and the level of adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet. The subjects were Spanish men (n = 1547) and women (n = 1615) aged 25-74 y who were examined in 1999-2000, in a population-based, cross-sectional survey in the northeast of Spain (Girona). Dietary intake was assessed using a FFQ. A Mediterranean diet score, including foods considered to be characteristic components of the traditional Mediterranean diet (vegetables, fruits, pulses, nuts, fish, meat, cereals, olive oil, and wine) was created. An increase of 5 U in the dietary score was associated with a change in the BMI of 0.43 (P = 0.030) and 0.68 (P = 0.007), after controlling for potential confounders, in men and women, respectively. The obesity risk decreased in men (P = 0.010) and women (P = 0.013) with increasing adherence to the traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern. The population in the top tertile of this score were less likely to be obese in both genders [odds ratio (OR) and (95% CI): 0.61 (0.40-0.92) in men; 0.61 (0.40-0.93) in women] after adjusting for potential confounders. These data suggest that the traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern is inversely associated with BMI and obesity.

[INST]  Retrieve all food entities contained in the text:   The objective of this study was to investigate prebiotic potential, chemical composition, and antioxidant capacity of spice extracts. Seven culinary spices including black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, ginger, Mediterranean oregano, rosemary, and turmeric were extracted with boiling water. Major chemical constituents were characterized by RP-HPLC-DAD method and antioxidant capacity was determined by measuring colorimetrically the extent to scavenge ABTS radical cations. Effects of spice extracts on the viability of 88 anaerobic and facultative isolates from intestinal microbiota were determined by using Brucella agar plates containing serial dilutions of extracts. A total of 14 phenolic compounds, a piperine, cinnamic acid, and cinnamaldehyde were identified and quantitated. Spice extracts exhibited high antioxidant capacity that correlated with the total amount of major chemicals. All spice extracts, with the exception of turmeric, enhanced the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. All spices exhibited inhibitory activity against selected Ruminococcus species. Cinnamon, oregano, and rosemary were active against selected Fusobacterium strains and cinnamon, rosemary, and turmeric were active against selected Clostridium spp. Some spices displayed prebiotic-like activity by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria, suggesting their potential role in the regulation of intestinal microbiota and the enhancement of gastrointestinal health. The identification and quantification of spice-specific phytochemicals provided insight into the potential influence of these chemicals on the gut microbial communities and activities. Future research on the connections between spice-induced changes in gut microbiota and host metabolism and disease preventive effect in animal models and humans is needed.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items mentioned in the text:   Potatoes, especially mashed potatoes, are known to result in high glycaemic and insulinaemic responses. However, in most meals, potatoes are accompanied by other foods. The objective of the present study was to investigate how glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to a mashed potato meal changed when a high-fat food (rapeseed oil), a high-protein food (chicken breast) and/or salad were added to the meal. Healthy subjects (n 11) ingested the test meals once and the reference food (glucose solution) twice in a random order at 1-week intervals. Capillary blood samples were then drawn for 2 h, and glucose and insulin were analysed. The 2 h glycaemic responses to six mashed potato-containing meals varied more than twofold. The glycaemic index (GI) of pure mashed potato was 108, whereas combined with chicken breast, rapeseed oil and salad, it was only 54. The latter GI also differed considerably from its predicted value of 103, which was based on the individual GI of the components of the meal. The insulinaemic indices of the mashed potato-based meals varied between 94 and 148. Chicken breast in the meal increased the insulinaemic response, and rapeseed oil diminished it. However, the insulinaemic response to mashed potato with chicken breast and rapeseed oil was lower than that to mashed potato alone. In conclusion, the protein, fat and salad contents of a meal exert considerable influence on the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to mashed potatoes. Furthermore, the estimation of the GI of a mixed meal by calculation is imprecise.

Data regarding nutritional status in GEP-NET patients are limited. The aim of the study was to investigate the nutritional status and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) in GEP-NET patients and to correlate them with tumor aggressiveness. A cross-sectional case-control observational study was conducted enrolling 83 patients with well-differentiated G1/G2 GEP-NETs after resection, as well as 83 healthy subjects, age, sex and body mass index-matched. Nutritional status was assessed by evaluating with Bioelectrical Impedance analysis and its phase angle (PhA), adherence to the MD according to PREDIMED score, dietary assessment, anthropometric parameters, and clinico-pathological characteristics. GEP-NET patients consumed less frequently vegetables, fruits, wine, fish/seafood, nuts, and more frequently red/processed meats, butter, cream, margarine, and soda drinks than controls. Patients with more aggressive disease presented a lower adherence to MD according to PREDIMED categories in comparison to G1, localized and free/stable disease status. A smaller PhA value and a lower PREDIMED score were significantly correlated with G2 tumor, metastases, and progressive disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting an association between nutritional status and tumor aggressiveness in a selected group of GEP-NETs. Moreover, higher intakes of food of MD, may represent a potential tool for prevention of tumor aggressiveness. Thus, a skilled nutritionist should be an integral part of the multidisciplinary management of GEP-NET patients.

To cope with this issue, researchers in the agricultural sector have implemented deficit irrigation strategies intended to reduce water consumption by increasing fruit quality. Almond is among the most popular tree nuts worldwide and also the most nut cultivated in Spain. Almond consumption, together with other nuts, has been widely associated with improvements in cardiovascular health, metabolic syndrome and diabetes owing to their bioactive compounds such as polyphenols. Water deficit strategies generate hydroSOStainable almonds, raised under water stress conditions, with high content of bioactive compounds. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between water stress, color and polyphenols in hydroSOStainable almonds. For this, instrumental color, total phenolic content and phenolic compounds were measured and correlated using Pearson's correlation.

The Japan Collaborative Cohort Study was established in 1988-1990 and consisted of 47,997 men and 66,520 women observed until the end of 1999. A self-administered food-frequency questionnaire was used as a baseline survey. Hazard ratios for dietary factors were calculated by Cox's proportional hazards model. During the observation period, 63 men and 25 women died of urothelial cancer. Increasing age, male gender, and history of smoking were all significantly associated with increased risk of urothelial cancer death. A high intake of milk and fruits other than oranges reduced the risk significantly and dose dependently, in particular among subjects with smoking history. However, consumption of butter and yogurt had no associations with the risk. Intakes of cabbage, lettuce, green leafy vegetables, carrots, squash, tomatoes, and oranges were not significantly associated with the risk. It was suggested that urothelial cancer death could be potentially preventable by smoking cessation and regular intake of milk and fruit.

The clinical features of 84 patients with rhinitis, asthma, urticaria, and/or anaphylaxis whose inhalant allergy was exclusively to Artemisia vulgaris were studied and compared with a control group of 50 patients monosensitized to grass pollen. The mean age for the beginning of symptoms was 30.2 years, and this was higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). We found the main incidence to be in women (70.2%). Some 42.3% had family history of atopia, lower than in the control group (P < 0.05), while the prevalence of asthma and urticaria was significantly higher (P < 0.05). Food hypersensitivity was reported by 23 patients (27.3%) allergic to Artemisia. The foods responsible (with respective numbers of cases) were honey (14), sunflower seeds (11), camomile (four), pistachio (three), hazelnut (two), lettuce (two), pollen (two), beer (two), almond (one), peanut (one), other nuts (one), carrot (one), and apple (one). None of the patients monosensitized to grass had food allergy. CAP inhibition experiments were carried out on a single patient.

After 6.3 years of follow-up (1986-1992), over 1,000 incident cases of colorectal cancer were registered. Using case-cohort analysis, the authors calculated rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for age, alcohol intake, and family history of colorectal cancer. For colon cancer, no statistically significant associations with total vegetable intake or total fruit intake were found. However, among women, an inverse association was observed with vegetables and fruits combined (for the highest quintile vs. the lowest, the rate ratio was 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.44, 1.01)). Brassica vegetables and cooked leafy vegetables showed inverse associations for both men and women. Among women and, to a lesser extent, among men, inverse associations were stronger for distal colonic tumors than for proximal colonic tumors. For rectal cancer, no statistically significant associations were found for vegetable consumption or fruit consumption or for specific groups of vegetables and fruits; only Brassica vegetables showed a positive association in women.

[INST]  Identify all references to food entities in the text:   Myosmine has been regarded as a specific tobacco alkaloid until investigations pointed out that nuts and nut products constitute a significant source of myosmine. In the present study it is shown that the occurrence of myosmine is widespread throughout a large number of plant families. Using a method for extraction practicable for all examined foods, quantitative analysis through internal standard addition showed nanograms per gram amounts. Positively tested edibles were staple foods such as maize, rice, wheat flour, millet, potato, and milk and also cocoa, popcorn, tomato, carrot, pineapple, kiwi, and apples. No myosmine was detectable in other vegetables and fruits such as lettuce, spinach, cucumber, onion, banana, tangerines, and grapes.

This review summarizes human studies and clinical trials of polyphenols as anti-diabetic agents. Polyphenols from coffee, guava tea, whortleberry, olive oil, propolis, chocolate, red wine, grape seed, and cocoa have been reported to show anti-diabetic effects in T2D patients through increasing glucose metabolism, improving vascular function as well as reducing insulin resistance and HbA1c level. However, individual flavonoid or isoflavonoid compounds appear to have no therapeutic effect on diabetes, based on the limited clinical data. Preliminary clinical trials provided evidence that resveratrol had anti-diabetic activity in humans by improving glycemic control in subjects with insulin resistance. Besides, anthocyanins exhibited anti-diabetic properties by reducing blood glucose and HbA1c levels or the improvement of insulin secretion and resistance. The structure-activity relationship of polyphenols as anti-diabetic agents in humans has been rarely reported.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food items from the text:   The usual choice of spread used on bread, and the calculated total amount of fat spread on bread per day, were related to socio-economic and coronary artery disease risk factors in 9003 respondents in the Health and Lifestyle Survey. Butter was the most popular spread, regardless of social group or income. Polyunsaturated margarine and low fat spread were chosen significantly more frequently by those in the higher socio-economic groups and by non-smokers in each group. A past history of heart disease was associated with the choice of polyunsaturated margarine, low fat spread, or no spread at all; this was most apparent in men. No such relationship was found between choice of spread and family history of heart disease or hypertension. Overweight and obese respondents were a little more likely than lean respondents to choose low fat spread or no spread. Men over 60 years consumed less fat, as spread, than younger men, but in women there was a tendency for consumption to increase with age. In both sexes, the non-manual groups consumed less spread than the manual at comparable ages. Smokers in each group consumed significantly more than non-smokers. The amount of spread consumed was not associated with body mass index, a past history or family history of heart disease or previously diagnosed hypertension. These findings suggest that current recommendations to reduce total fat intake and to reduce the proportion of saturated fats used are not being followed, at least in respect of spread, by those at greatest risk of coronary heart disease.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms contained in the text:   Our preliminary clinical trial showed that consumption of cooked rice of a Japanese common cultivar Yukihikari improved atopic dermatitis associated with a suspected rice allergy, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesised that the ameliorating effect of Yukihikari on atopic dermatitis is associated with the gut microbiota. BALB/c mice were fed a synthetic diet supplemented with uncooked and polished white rice powder prepared from one of four different cultivars: Yukihikari, rice A (common rice), rice B (brewery rice) and rice C (waxy rice). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that the composition of faecal microbiota was different between mice fed Yukihikari and those fed rice A. Analysis of the 16S rRNA clone library and species-specific real-time PCR showed that the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin degrader, tended to be lower in mice fed Yukihikari. The incidence of allergic diarrhoea induced by oral administration of ovalbumin in systemically immunised mice was lower in mice fed Yukihikari, albeit with no difference in serum antibodies specific to ovalbumin. In a separate experiment, serum antibody levels specific to orally administered ovalbumin were lower in mice fed Yukihikari. Additionally, the translocation of horseradish peroxidase in isolated segments of ileum and colon tended to be lower in mice fed Yukihikari, suggesting a reduction in gut permeability in mice fed Yukihikari. These data indicate that changes in the gut microbiota of mice fed Yukihikari could be advantageous in the prevention of food allergy.

This review aims to characterize and assess food consumption patterns and nutrient intakes amongst school-aged children (5-10 years) and adolescents (10-19 years) in countries of the EMR. Electronic databases (MedLine, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant articles published between 2005 and 2020; international organizations and governmental websites were also searched. Available studies documented low intakes of fruits, vegetables and fiber, inadequate consumption of water, milk and dairy products, coupled with high intakes of fat, saturated fat, and sugar sweetened beverages, as well as a frequent consumption of energy-dense, nutrient poor foods such as sweet and savory snacks. Micronutrient inadequacies were also observed, particularly for calcium, iron, zinc and vitamins A, D, C, and folate.

Laboratory studies suggest polyphenols may exert breast cancer preventive effects through modulation of endogenous sex hormone levels. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of pomegranate juice consumption on serum levels of estradiol, estrone, testosterone, androstenedione, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Sixty-four healthy postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to drink 8 ounces of either 100% commercial pomegranate juice (intervention) or apple juice (control) for 3 weeks. Overall, women in the intervention group did not experience any significant decline in serum sex hormones or SHBG compared to women in the control group. In subgroup analyses restricted to 38 normal weight women, women in the intervention group compared to control group had a significant decline in estrone (pg/mL) and testosterone levels (pg/mL): pomegranate: -61.6 [95% confidence interval (CI): -175.8 to 52.6), apple: 1.1 (95% CI: -5.4 to 7.7), P = 0.05, and pomegranate: -289.1 (95% CI: -630.7 to 52.5), apple: 79.6 (95% CI: -77.8 to 236.9), P = 0.03, respectively.

Oxidized starches have been utilized in many coating applications for their adhesion ability. However, it is not known if they perform similarly in bake-only products. This study investigated the application of oxidized starch in bake-only chicken nuggets. Oxidized starches were prepared from 7 starches and analyzed for gelatinization and pasting properties. Chicken nuggets were prepared using batter containing wheat flour, oxidized starch, salt, and leavening agents prior to steaming, oven baking, freezing, and final oven baking for sensory evaluation. All nuggets were analyzed for hardness by a textural analyzer, crispness by an acoustic sound, and sensory characteristics by a trained panel. The oxidation level used in the study did not alter the gelatinization temperature of most starches, but increased the peak pasting viscosity of both types of corn and rice starches and decreased that of tapioca and potato starches. There were slight differences in peak force and acoustic reading between some treatments; however, the differences were not consistent with starch type or amylose content.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Proteins play a crucial role in metabolism, in maintaining fluid and acid-base balance and antibody synthesis. Dietary proteins are important nutrients and are classified into: 1) animal proteins (meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy), and, 2) plant proteins (legumes, nuts and soy). Dietary modification is one of the most important lifestyle changes that has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) by attenuating related risk factors. The CVD burden is reduced by optimum diet through replacement of unprocessed meat with low saturated fat, animal proteins and plant proteins. In view of the available evidence, it has become acceptable to emphasize the role of optimum nutrition to maintain arterial and CV health. Such healthy diets are thought to increase satiety, facilitate weight loss, and improve CV risk. Different studies have compared the benefits of omnivorous and vegetarian diets. Animal protein related risk has been suggested to be greater with red or processed meat over and above poultry, fish and nuts, which carry a lower risk for CVD. In contrast, others have shown no association of red meat intake with CVD. The aim of this expert opinion recommendation was to elucidate the different impact of animal vs vegetable protein on modifying cardiometabolic risk factors. Many observational and interventional studies confirmed that increasing protein intake, especially plant-based proteins and certain animal-based proteins (poultry, fish, unprocessed red meat low in saturated fats and low-fat dairy products) have a positive effect in modifying cardiometabolic risk factors. Red meat intake correlates with increased CVD risk, mainly because of its non-protein ingredients (saturated fats). However, the way red meat is cooked and preserved matters. Thus, it is recommended to substitute red meat with poultry or fish in order to lower CVD risk. Specific amino acids have favourable results in modifying major risk factors for CVD, such as hypertension. Apart from meat, other animal-source proteins, like those found in dairy products (especially whey protein) are inversely correlated to hypertension, obesity and insulin resistance.

The course addressed nutrition practices associated with the reduction of risk for coronary heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and obesity. Teaching teams, consisting of an extension agent and a registered dietitian, were used in course delivery. A wide variety of printed and audiovisual teaching aids helped participants learn through discussion, goal setting, games, and food tasting. Evaluation components of the course included demographic and pre- and post-course food frequency information as well as an overall evaluation by each participant. Post-course evaluation data were collected at a reunion session held 2 months after course completion. One hundred forty-two of 195 participants (73%) completed the course and the evaluation. Three-fourths of the participants had a family history of at least one of the life-style diseases addressed by the course. The food frequency results indicated that participants made some significant changes in their food practices. They decreased the number of times they selected high-fat cheese, regular red meats, foods from the saturated fatty acid group, desserts, sodium-rich products, and tea/coffee (p less than .05), and they increased selection of low-fat dairy products (p less than .05).

As is known, diet plays an important role in the management of diabetes. However, the dietary habits of Saharawi diabetic women are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the dietary habits and established their relationship with the nutritional status and glycemic profile of such women. We recruited 65 Saharawi type II diabetic women taking orally glucose-lowering drugs only. Dietary habits were investigated using qualitative 24 h recall carried out over three non-consecutive days. Anthropometric measurements were taken and blood parameters were measured. About 80% of the women were overweight and about three out of four women had uncompensated diabetes and were insulin resistant. The Saharawi diet was found to mainly include cereals, oils, sugars, vegetables (especially onions, tomatoes, and carrots), tea, and meat. Principal component analysis identified two major dietary patterns, the first one "healthy" and the second one "unhealthy".

Rice is rarely eaten alone such that it is of interest to investigate the effects of co-ingesting different protein-rich meals with rice on insulin and glycaemic response. This study had a randomised, controlled, non-blind, cross-over design in which fifteen healthy Chinese male participants were required to come on non-consecutive days. Five rice-based test meals were served: rice alone (control), rice with fish (RWF), rice with egg white (RWE), rice with soya beancurd (taukwa) (RWT) and rice with chicken (RWC). The control meal consisted of 50 g of available carbohydrate, whereas all other test meals contained additional 25 g of protein. RWT was the only meal that showed significantly lower glucose response when compared with the control (P<0<U+00B7>05). RWF and RWE had significantly higher insulin response, but no significant increase was observed in RWT and RWC when compared with the control (P<0<U+00B7>05). RWT and RWF showed significantly higher glucagon secretion as compared with the control (P<0<U+00B7>05). The four test meals studied showed varying effects, with RWT showing the greatest reduction in glycaemic response. Therefore, the ingestion of soya beancurd with rice may have a direct impact on reducing the risk in Asians transiting from being pre-diabetics to diabetics.

Yet, its association with hypertension has scarcely been studied, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We aimed to estimate the associations between consumption of UPF (total, liquid and solid) and UPF subgroups and incident hypertension in a prospective cohort study. We used data from the Mexican Teachers' Cohort including 64 934 disease-free women aged <U+2265>25 years at baseline. We assessed baseline usual dietary intake using a validated FFQ, and each item was categorised according to NOVA, a degree of food processing classification system. UPF and UPF subgroups were categorised according to the distribution of their contribution to total energy intake. Hypertension was self-reported. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95 % CI. During a median follow-up of 2<U+00B7>2 years, we identified 3752 incident cases of hypertension. Mean contribution of UPF to total energy intake was 29<U+00B7>8 (SD 9<U+00B7>4) % energy (23<U+00B7>4 (SD 8<U+00B7>9) % solid, 6<U+00B7>4 (SD 4<U+00B7>8) % liquid). Comparing extreme categories showed that higher total and solid UPF consumptions were not associated with incident hypertension (IRR 0<U+00B7>96, 95 % CI 0<U+00B7>79, 1<U+00B7>16; IRR 0<U+00B7>91, 95 % CI 0<U+00B7>82, 1<U+00B7>01, respectively).

Beer explained a large proportion of variation in GI in a Finnish and an American study. However, few beers have been tested according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) methodology. We tested the GI of beer and estimated its contribution to dietary GI and GL in the Netherlands. GI testing of pilsner beer (Pilsner Urquell) was conducted at The University of Sydney according to ISO international standards with glucose as the reference food. Subsequently, GI and GL values were assigned to 2556 food items in the 2011 Dutch food composition table using a six-step methodology and consulting four databases. This table was linked to dietary data from 2106 adults in the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 2007-2010. Stepwise linear regression identified contribution to inter-individual variation in dietary GI and GL. The GI of pilsner beer was 89 (SD 5). Beer consumption contributed to 9<U+00B7>6 and 5<U+00B7>3% inter-individual variation in GI and GL, respectively. Other foods that contributed to the inter-individual variation in GI and GL included potatoes, bread, soft drinks, sugar, candy, wine, coffee and tea. The results were more pronounced in men than in women. In conclusion, beer is a high-GI food. Despite its relatively low carbohydrate content (approximately 4-5 g/100 ml), it still made a contribution to dietary GL, especially in men.

Cancer patients received either a treatment support diet (TD, for those with chemotherapy), or a remission support diet (RD; for those in remission) for at least 3 wk (21-61 days). Both diets were low glycemic, low fat, and high plant protein diets; the diet for the TD group contained an additional 0.5 servings of protein. Based on clinical values, additional amounts of garlic, onion, tomato, shiitake, rice bran, kale, blueberry, pineapples, and/or turmeric powder were provided in regular meals. Estimated daily intake of protein, plant fat, garlic, onion, allicin, and quercetin was greater in the TD compared to the RD. An increased intake of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium and a reduction in D-dimer were noted compared to baseline diets in both groups.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food items from the text:   The olive tree (Olea europaea) is widely cultivated for the production of both oil and table olives and very significant because of its economic value. Olive and olive oil, a traditional food product with thousands of years of history, are the essential components of the Mediterranean diet and are largely consumed in the world. Beside of their economical contribution to national economy, these are an important food in terms of their nutritional value. Olive and olive oil may have a role in the prevention of coronary heart disease and certain cancers because of their high levels of monosaturated fatty acids and phenolic compounds. In addition, olives (Olea europaea L.) and olive oils provide a rich source of natural antioxidants. These make them both fairly stable against auto-oxidation and suitable for human health. The aim of this paper is to define the historical development and nutritional importance of olive and olive oil constituted an important part of the Mediterranean diet.

With increasing content of iron compounds, up to 25-fold higher concentrations of the toxic lipid oxidation products malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and other volatile aldehydes were formed during digestion, together with increased protein carbonyl compounds as measurement of protein oxidation. Nitrite curing of all meats lowered lipid and protein oxidation to the level of oxidation in uncured chicken. Strongly depending on the individual fecal inoculum, colonic digestion of beef resulted in significantly higher concentrations of the NOC-specific DNA adduct O(6)-carboxymethyl-guanine compared to chicken and pork, whereas nitrite curing had no significant effect.

Limited data suggest a more favorable mortality experience for drinkers of wine than for drinkers of liquor or beer. To examine these relations, the authors performed a cohort study of participants in a large Northern California prepaid health care program. Demographic and history data were collected from 128,934 adults undergoing health evaluations in 1978-1985, with subsequent death ascertained by an automated linkage system. Cox proportional hazards models with eight covariates were used to determine relative risk estimates according to total alcohol intake and days per week of drinking wine, wine types, beer, or liquor. The J-shaped alcohol-mortality relation was stable for 20 years. Independently, frequency of wine drinking was associated with lower mortality risk (p<0.001) largely because of lower coronary disease risk. Similar risk reductions were associated with red wine, white wine, other types of wine, and combinations of wine types. Much of the lower risk associated with light drinking was related to wine drinking. The authors conclude that drinkers of any type of wine have a lower mortality risk than do beer or liquor drinkers, but it remains unclear whether this reduced risk is due to nonalcoholic wine ingredients, drinking pattern, or associated traits.

In the process, consumption of animal products increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and other disorders. This dietary pattern also promotes the growth of unhealthful gut bacteria, fostering, among other things, the production of trimethylamine N-oxide, a proinflammatory compound associated with cardiovascular and neurological diseases. When omnivorous individuals change to a plant-based diet, diet quality as measured by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index improves, and the risk of these health problems diminishes.

CMHS is a multiethnic cohort of 84,170 men aged 45-69 years who were members of the Kaiser Permanente Southern and Northern California Health Plans. Information on demographic and lifestyle factors was collected using mailed questionnaires between 2002 and 2003. We used Cox models to estimate the effect of red wine on prostate cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 1,340 incident prostate cancer cases identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result-affiliated cancer registries were included in the analyses. We did not find a clear association between red wine intake and risk of prostate cancer. Hazard ratio (HR) estimates for consuming <1 drink/week, > or =1 drink/week but <1 drink/day and > or =1 drink/day were 0.89, 95% confidence interval (0.74-1.07), 0.99 (0.83-1.17) and 0.88 (0.70-1.12), respectively. Further, we observed no linear dose response. The lack of association for red wine intake was consistently observed when we restricted the analyses to those with and without a history of PSA screening. In addition, we also did not observe any association with prostate cancer for beer, white wine, liquor or combined alcoholic beverage intake (HR for combined alcoholic beverage intake of > or =5 drinks/day = 1.16 (0.83-1.63).

However, red wine has been promoted as a beneficial part of a nutritious diet. The evidence is that beer is at least the equal of wine from a nutritional perspective and in countering ailments such as coronary heart disease. This study used surveys to compare beer and wine consumers' perceptions of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. The consumers ranked 7 beverages based upon perceived healthfulness both before and after they were exposed to nutritional information about the beverages. The ranked data were analyzed using analysis of variance. The variance due to the 3-way interaction of place of recruitment, beverage, and ranking was found to be significant at P < 0.05. There was no significant difference between genders. Overall, consumers of alcoholic beverages perceived red wine to be more healthful than the other 6 beverages, including beer and white wine. The perceived healthfulness of a beverage does not appear to be the main factor driving the choice of beverage. Nutritional information does impact consumers' perceptions of the healthfulness of beverages.

Cocoa has been shown to exert anti-diabetic effects by lowering glucose levels. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this preventive activity and whether cocoa exerts potential beneficial effects on the insulin signaling pathway in the liver remain largely unknown. Thus, in this study, the potential anti-diabetic properties of cocoa on glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling were evaluated in type 2 diabetic Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Male ZDF rats were fed a control or cocoa-rich diet (10%), and Zucker lean animals received the control diet. ZDF rats supplemented with cocoa (ZDF-Co) showed a significant decrease in body weight gain, glucose and insulin levels, as well as an improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Cocoa-rich diet further ameliorated the hepatic insulin resistance by abolishing the increased serine-phosphorylated levels of the insulin receptor substrate 1 and preventing the inactivation of the glycogen synthase kinase 3/glycogen synthase pathway in the liver of cocoa-fed ZDF rats. The anti-hyperglycemic effect of cocoa appeared to be at least mediated through the decreased levels of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and increased values of glucokinase and glucose transporter 2 in the liver of ZDF-Co rats. Moreover, cocoa-rich diet suppressed c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 activation caused by insulin resistance. These findings suggest that cocoa has the potential to alleviate both hyperglycemia and hepatic insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic ZDF rats.

This review considers whether current intakes of sugar are harmful to health, and analyses recent literature using a systematic approach to collate, rank, and evaluate published studies from 1995-2006. Results from high quality obesity studies did not suggest a positive association between body mass index and sugar intake. Some studies, specifically on sweetened beverages, highlighted a potential concern in relation to obesity risk, although these were limited by important methodological issues. Diet adequacy appeared to be achieved across sugar intakes of 6 to 20% energy, depending on subject age. Studies on metabolic syndrome reported no adverse effects of sugar in the long-term, even at intakes of 40-50% energy. The evidence for colorectal cancer suggested an association with sugar, but this appeared to have been confounded by energy intake and glycemic load. There was no credible evidence linking sugar with attention-deficit, dementia, or depression. Regarding dental caries, combinations of sugar amount/frequency, fluoride exposure, and food adhesiveness were more reliable predictors of caries risk than the amount of sugar alone.

[INST]  Find all mentions of food entities in the text:   Previously, a lower risk of colorectal cancer was observed with fruit and vegetable consumption in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition within a follow-up period of 9 years which was not fully supported by a recent meta-analysis. Therefore, we were interested in the relation with extended follow-up, also focusing on single subtypes and a variety of intake of fruit and vegetables. Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed at baseline. After an average of 13 years of follow-up, 3,370 participants were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer. Diet diversity scores were constructed to quantify variety in fruit and vegetable consumption. A lower risk of colon cancer was observed with higher self-reported consumption of fruit and vegetable combined (HR Q4 vs. Q1 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-1.01, p for trend 0.02), but no consistent association was observed for separate consumption of fruits and vegetables. No associations with risk of rectal cancer were observed. The few observed associations for some fruit and vegetable subtypes with colon cancer risk may have been due to chance. Variety in consumption of fruits and vegetables was not associated with a lower risk of colon or rectal cancer. Although a lower risk of colon cancer is suggested with high consumption of fruit and vegetables, this study does not support a clear inverse association between fruit and vegetable consumption and colon or rectal cancer beyond a follow-up of more than 10 years. Attenuation of the risk estimates from dietary changes over time cannot be excluded, but appears unlikely.

[INST]  Extract all food entities present in the text:   Radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) of sera from subjects sensitized to wheat and rye flour indicated that there is significant reaction with seed extracts of 12 cereals (wheat, durum wheat, triticale, cereal rye, barley, rye grass, oats, canary grass, rice, maize, sorghum and Johnson grass). Results were evaluated in terms of taxonomic relationships and of the electrophoretically determined protein composition of the cereal extracts. RAST uptakes were uniformly low in sera from four rhinitic bakers, yet were significantly above the levels for non-allergic and cord sera. Much higher RAST uptakes were obtained with sera from four asthmatic bakers when tested with wheat and its close relatives, but there was still reasonably high reactivity with more distantly related cereals. RAST inhibition experiments indicated in a more direct way the extent of cross-reactivity between grain extracts of wheat, rye, barley and oats. One baker had a history of more severe attacks of breathlessness following inhalation of rye flour compared with wheat flour. This was confirmed by bronchial challenge testing, but the comparison was not obviously consistent with the results of prick testing or estimation of histamine released from his leucocytes. The results as a whole suggested that the bran layers of cereal grains are at least as allergenic as flour.

[INST]  Extract all food entities referenced in the text:   Food extracts for diagnostic purposes often lack sufficient activity and consistency. Biologically standardized food extracts are not available on the market. Using extracts from plant-derived foods as examples, we investigated factors which may be important for the quality of such extracts. Divergent allergenic activities were found between strains of apples, but not within varieties of celery tuber (celeriac), hazelnut, and peanut, respectively. Heating of the food remarkably reduced the activity of apple, hazelnut, and celeriac, but had little effect on peanut. By contrast, heating of semipurified protein extracts from celery tuber and apple for 30 min at 100 degrees C did not deplete the immunoreactivity of the major allergens, indicating that this is an inappropriate test for identifying labile food allergens. Due to their high endogenous enzyme activities, apples and other fruits require special extraction procedures applying either low temperature or enzyme inhibitors. Variation of extraction conditions had little effect on the composition and activity of extracts from hazelnut. The storage stability of skin test solutions from plant foods can be improved by avoiding phenol as an additive and by including 50% of glycerol. For model studies considering neoallergens, IgE was raised in mice against native and heated celery tuber, respectively. When extracts from nonthermally and thermally processed celeriac were subjected to an RBL-cell mediator release assay with these sera, an inverse ranking was obtained with anti-heated celeriac IgE and anti-native celeriac IgE, respectively. These data indicated that new epitopes had been formed by the heating process. Since all parameters were tested in model experiments with either human or murine IgE, their relevance has to be proven in further clinical investigations.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related entities mentioned in the text:   Carob germ proteins have been shown to have functional properties similar to wheat gluten enabling formulation and production of yeast leavened gluten-free baked goods from a true dough rather than a stiff batter. The purpose of this research was to optimize the production of wheat-free bread containing carob germ flour, corn starch, NaCl, sucrose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and H<U+2082>O. A key criterion was to formulate viscoelastic dough similar to wheat dough. To that end, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine optimal levels of carob germ flour, H<U+2082>O, and HPMC. Components varied as follows: 4.94%-15.05% for carob germ flour, 0.05%-3.75% HPMC, and 65.25%-83.75% H<U+2082>O (percents are on a flour basis, where carob germ flour in combination with maize starch equals 100%). Sucrose, NaCl, and yeast were held constant at 2%. Bread parameters evaluated were specific volume and crumb hardness, where the largest specific volume and the lowest value for crumb hardness were considered most desirable. The optimum formula as determined by RSM consisted of 7% carob germ flour, 93% maize starch, 2% HPMC, and 80% H<U+2082>O with predicted crumb hardness of ~200 g of force and a specific volume of ~3.5 cm<U+00B3>/g. When proof time was optimized, a specific volume of ~5.6 ml/g and crumb hardness value of ~156 g of force was observed.

Although associations between fruit and vegetable intake and both ESCC and EAC have been found in multiple ecological and case-control studies, few prospective studies have investigated these associations. We prospectively examined these associations in 490,802 participants of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study using Cox models adjusted for age, alcohol intake, body mass index, cigarette smoking, education, physical activity and total energy intake. We present hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals per serving per 1,000 calories. During 2,193,751 person years of follow-up, 103 participants were diagnosed with ESCC and 213 participants with EAC. We found a significant inverse association between total fruit and vegetable intake and ESCC risk (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91), but not EAC risk (0.98, 0.90-1.08). In models mutually adjusted for fruit and vegetable intake, the protective association with ESCC was stronger for fruits (0.73, 0.57-0.93) than for vegetables (0.84, 0.66-1.07). When we examined botanical subgroups, we observed significant protective associations for ESCC and intake of Rosacea (apples, peaches, nectarines, plums, pears and strawberries) and Rutaceae (citrus fruits). A significant inverse association between EAC and Chenopodiaceae (spinach) intake was observed.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms mentioned in the text:   White rice is classified as having a low to high glycemic index (GI) depending on its amylose:amylopectin ratio. High GI food can be detrimental to diabetics since they can rapidly increase the glucose level in blood during digestion. Instant rice is increasing in popularity and is produced by dehydrating whole grain cooked rice, therefore, to make it more suitable for diabetics, the effect of the processes involved in the production on GI were tested. The objective was to optimize cooking temperature and the ratio of water to rice to reduce in vitro starch digestibility and GI of instant rice made from three Thai rice cultivars (Hom Mali (KDML105), Pathumthani Fragrant (PT) and Sao Hai (SH)) that had different amylose contents. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the cooking conditions. The rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content and estimated glycemic index (eGI) decreased as cooking temperature decreased and the ratio of water to rice increased. The decrease in RDS content was associated with the increase in both slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) contents. The microstructure of instant rice kernels after cooking at higher temperature or lower volumes of water showed larger voids and a less compact surface, which facilitated enzymatic accessibility and increased starch digestibility. Rice cooked at higher temperature (90 <U+00B0>C) showed lower peak viscosity and breakdown in pasting properties, compared with lower temperature 82 <U+00B0>C. The optimal cooking condition for producing lower GI instant rice was cooking at 82 <U+00B0>C with 1.9-fold water volume. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Rice has a high glycemic index (GI) that makes it unsuitable for consumption by many people with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Therefore, preparation of an instant rice product with a lower GI would ensure the product was beneficial to a wider range of the population.

[INST]  Extract all food entities present in the text:   We aimed to identify dietary patterns in a Danish adult population and assess the reproducibility of the dietary patterns identified. Baseline data of 3,372 women and 3,191 men (30-60 years old) from the population-based survey Inter99 was used. Food intake, assessed by a FFQ, was aggregated into thirty-four separate food groups. Dietary patterns were identified by principal component analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis and Bland Altman plots were used to assess the reproducibility of the dietary patterns identified. The Bland Altman plots were used as an alternative and new method. Two factors were retained for both women and men, which accounted for 15.1-17.4 % of the total variation.

[INST]  Extract all food items from the text:   Epidemiologic evidence of a protective role for fruits and vegetables in cancer prevention is substantial. The strength of this scientific base guides US national policymaking in diet and health issues and facilitates community and local programs that address national dietary goals to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. Current scientific evidence also suggests a protective role for fruits and vegetables in prevention of coronary heart disease, and evidence is accumulating for a protective role in stroke. In addition, a new scientific base is emerging to support a protective role for fruits and vegetables in prevention of cataract formation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diverticulosis, and possibly, hypertension. This article provides an overview of the health benefits associated with fruit and vegetable consumption for each of these conditions, including brief discussions of underlying protective mechanisms, identifies key scientific findings regarding the health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption, and outlines applications of these findings for dietetics professionals. The evidence reviewed provides additional support for increased consumption of a wide variety of vegetables, in particular, dark-green leafy, cruciferous, and deep-yellow-orange ones, and a wide variety of fruits, in particular, citrus and deep-yellow-orange ones. Continued attention to increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is a practical and important way to optimize nutrition to reduce disease risk and maximize good health.

[INST]  Identify all references to food present in the text:   At birth, calves are functionally monogastric and remain so for the first weeks of life. Milk in the rumen may cause indigestion, diarrhea, and reduced growth. Calves are often fed cold milk from a large-aperture teat, but warm milk and sucking behavior are believed to trigger the esophageal reflex. The aim of this study was to use radiography to estimate the lowest milk temperature that can be given to dairy calves at high and low intake rates without causing milk in the rumen. Our hypothesis was that cold milk drunk at high speed would cause insufficient closure of the esophageal groove and hence milk in the rumen. Fifteen Norwegian Red calves, 9 to 27 d of age, weighing between 45.5 and 71.0 kg, were tested according to the response surface pathway design. Each calf was offered 4 L of milk from both a small- (2 mm) and a large-aperture (19 mm) teat. The milk contained barium sulfate, and radiography was applied before, during, and after the milk meal. Following radiography, the calves were returned to a group pen and observed for 2 h using continuous live behavioral observation to detect signs of abdominal pain or discomfort. Starting with a low number of subjects and increasing this number with increasing design levels reduces the sample size without reducing the statistical power. The minimum milk temperature was estimated to be 8<U+00B0>C. No behavioral signs of pain or discomfort were observed, but shivering was noted in several calves drinking 8<U+00B0>C milk. These results strengthen the argument that calves can be fed large milk meals without risk of causing milk in the rumen, even cold milk drunk at high speed.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   In this study, pot experiments were conducted to determine the effects of industrial solid wastes (ISWs) (ceramic, stone, and sugar factory wastes) and organic wastes (rice husk and wheat straw) on growth and heavy metals uptake by tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) plants. The soil was treated with 10% of ISWs and 5% of organic wastes. The fractionation of heavy metals also has been studied in all treated soils. It was observed that the addition of ISWs in soil increased heavy metal contents in all fractions. The addition of organic wastes to control and treated soils decreased exchangeable fraction and increased organic matter and residual fractions. Following the ceramic factory and stone cutting waste addition, tomato yield significantly decreased as compared to control soil. The application of ISWs caused an increase in heavy metal contents of tomato plants. In control and ISWs-treated soils, dry matter yield of tomato grown in the presence of wheat straw was significantly restricted, while the application of rice husk increased tomato shoot and root dry weight. Results of experiments indicated that the application of both organic wastes significantly decreased heavy metal uptake by tomato plants. The investigation of health risk index (HRI) values indicated that in these industrial areas, potential health risk by intake of heavy metals from tomato for both adults and children generally assumed to be safe. The values of HRI were lesser when rice husk was applied to the soil. In general, these results highlighted that the application of rice husk in soils contaminated with ISWs increased the growth and yield of tomato and reduced the heavy metal toxicity for tomato consumption in contaminated soils.

Cases (399) and a corresponding number of controls, matched for age and sex, were included, the controls being selected from patients undergoing functional re-education for injuries or trauma which reduced their mobility. A dietary history questionnaire was used to determine the usual eating habits during the year preceding diagnosis for cases, or preceding interview for controls. The cases reported lower consumption of vegetables and oil than controls, but no differences were seen in the consumption of meat, bread, eggs or butter. The intake of several nutrients, particularly vitamins B2, B6, C, potassium, iron, magnesium and vegetable fibre, was lower among cases. However, when all these nutrients were analysed jointly and adjusted one for the other, only potassium retained a significant effect. This may be due to the high degree of colinearity between the estimated intake of many nutrients. No association was seen with fat or fibres from cereals.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   The low rate of coronary heart disease (CHD) in France compared with other developed countries with comparable dietary intake has been called the French paradox. We explored this paradox by looking at alcohol, diet, and mortality data from 21 developed, relatively affluent countries in the years 1965, 1970, 1980, and 1988. We assessed wine, beer, and spirits intake separately. France had the highest wine intake and the highest total alcohol intake, and the second lowest CHD mortality rate. In univariate analyses, ethanol in wine was slightly more inversely correlated with CHD than total wine volume. In multivariate analyses, animal fat tended to be positively correlated, and fruit consumption inversely correlated, with CHD. Beer and spirits were only weakly inversely correlated with CHD. The strongest and most consistent correlation was the inverse association of wine ethanol with CHD. However, wine ethanol was unrelated to total mortality. We conclude that ethanol, particularly wine ethanol, is inversely related to CHD but not to longevity in populations. Although light to moderate alcohol consumption may improve longevity, alcohol abuse--which sharply reduces longevity--is correlated with average alcohol consumption in populations. Thus, while the risk/benefit ratio varies for individuals, the use of alcohol for cardioprotective purposes should not be encouraged as a public health measure.

This relationship was examined in a case-control study conducted in 3 geographical areas of Canada [Metropolitan Toronto (Ontario), Montreal (Quebec), and Vancouver (British Columbia)] with 617 incident cases and 637 population controls. Complete history of beverage intake was assessed by a personal interview with reference to a 1-year period prior to diagnosis or interview. In age- and energy-adjusted models for all centers combined, the odds ratio (OR) for the highest quintile of total alcohol intake was 0.89. For alcoholic beverages separately, it was 0.68 for the highest tertile of beer, 1.12 for wine and 0.86 for liquor. The decreasing trend was significant for beer intake. The results were only significant for British Columbia out of all the 3 centers studied. Whereas coffee and cola intake was not associated with prostate cancer, a decrease in risk was observed with tea intake of more than 500 g per day (OR 0.70).

[INST]  Extract all food entities listed in the text:   Soybean oil consumption is increasing worldwide and parallels a rise in obesity. Rich in unsaturated fats, especially linoleic acid, soybean oil is assumed to be healthy, and yet it induces obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. Here, we show that the genetically modified soybean oil Plenish, which came on the U.S. market in 2014 and is low in linoleic acid, induces less obesity than conventional soybean oil in C57BL/6 male mice. Proteomic analysis of the liver reveals global differences in hepatic proteins when comparing diets rich in the two soybean oils, coconut oil, and a low-fat diet. Metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma shows a positive correlation between obesity and hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (<U+03C9>6) and omega-3 (<U+03C9>3) fatty acids (linoleic and <U+03B1>-linolenic acid, respectively) in the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. While Plenish induced less insulin resistance than conventional soybean oil, it resulted in hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction as did olive oil, which has a similar fatty acid composition. These results implicate a new class of compounds in diet-induced obesity-C18 epoxide and diol oxylipins.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food-related terms in the text:   Increasing evidence suggest that low-dose alcohol consumption (LAC) reduces the incidence and improves the functional outcome of ischemic stroke. We determined the influence of LAC on post-ischemic inflammation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups, an ethanol (13.5% alcohol) group, a red wine (Castle Rock Pinot Noir, 13.5% alcohol) group, and a control group. The amount of alcohol given to red wine and ethanol groups was 1.4<U+2009>g/kg/day. After 8 weeks, the animals were subjected to a 2-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and sacrificed at 24<U+2009>hours of reperfusion. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, expression of adhesion molecules and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, microglial activation and neutrophil infiltration were evaluated. The total infarct volume and neurological deficits were significantly reduced in red wine- and ethanol-fed rats compared to control rats. Both red wine and ethanol suppressed post-ischemic expression of adhesion molecules and microglial activation. In addition, both red wine and ethanol upregulated expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), downregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and significantly alleviated post-ischemic expression of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, red wine significantly reduced post-ischemic neutrophil infiltration. Our findings suggest that LAC may protect the brain against its I/R injury by suppressing post-ischemic inflammation.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food items from the text:   Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The agents capable of causing damage to genetic material are known as genotoxins and, according to their mode of action, are classified into mutagens, carcinogens, or teratogens. Genotoxins are also involved in the pathogenesis of several chronic degenerative diseases, including hepatic, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular disorders; diabetes; arthritis; cancer; chronic inflammation; and ageing. In recent decades, researchers have found novel bioactive phytocompounds able to counteract the effects of physical and chemical mutagens. Several studies have shown the antigenotoxic potential of different fruits and plants (Part 1). In this review (Part 2), we present a research overview conducted on some plants and vegetables (spirulina, broccoli, chamomile, cocoa, ginger, laurel, marigold, roselle, and rosemary), which are frequently consumed by humans. In addition, an analysis of some phytochemicals extracted from those vegetables and the analysis of a resin (propolis),whose antigenotoxic power has been demonstrated in various tests, including the Ames assay, sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus, and comet assay, was also performed.

Although some studies have found that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk, a recent study reported that red wine consumption is associated with reduced risk. We examined the association between alcohol use and prostate cancer among 34,565 men, 50-76 yr old, in the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort in Washington State. Alcohol consumption was ascertained by baseline questionnaire between October 2000 and December 2002. Incident prostate cancers (n = 816) as of December 31, 2004, were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. Men who consumed more than one drink per month had a small increased risk of prostate cancer (hazard ratio, HR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.02-1.40) compared with men who drank no alcohol or less than one drink per month. White wine consumption was associated with increased risk (HR for any vs. no white wine consumption = 1.27; CI = 1.08-1.49). Red wine, liquor, and beer were not associated with prostate cancer nor was total alcohol consumed at ages 18, 30, and 45. Associations of alcohol use with prostate cancer are modest and complex. More detailed assessment of specific alcoholic beverages is warranted in future studies.

This study aimed to assess the starch digestibility of white and red rice prepared with 2 oil types: vegetable oil (unsaturated fat) and ghee (clarified butter, saturated fat) added at 3 different time points during the cooking process ("before": frying raw rice in oil before boiling, "during": adding oil during boiling, and "after": stir-frying cooked rice in oil). Red rice produced a slower digestion rate than white rice. White rice digestibility was not affected by oil type, but was affected by addition time of oil. Adding oil "after" (stir-frying) to white or red rice resulted in higher slowly digestible starch. Red rice cooked using ghee showed the lowest amount of glucose release during in vitro digestion. The addition of ghee "during" (that is boiling with ghee) or "before" (that is frying rice raw with ghee then boiling) cooking showed potential for attenuating the postprandial glycemic response and increasing resistant starch content. This is the first report to show healthier ways of preparing rice. White rice with oil added "after" (stir-fried) may provide a source of sustained glucose and stabilize blood glucose levels. Boiling red rice with ghee or cooking red rice with ghee pilaf-style may provide beneficial effects on postprandial blood glucose and insulin concentrations, and improve colonic health. The encouraging results of the present study justify extending it to an in vivo investigation to conclusively determine the effect of time of addition of fat when rice is cooked on blood glucose homeostasis.

Cases were residents aged 21 to 79 years who were newly diagnosed with stomach cancer between March 1, 1994, and April 30, 1997. Controls were randomly selected from Warsaw residents registered at the nationwide Polish Electronic System of Residence Evidency, frequency-matched to cases by age and sex. Information on demographic characteristics; consumption of cigarettes, alcohol, tea and coffee; diet; medical history; family history of cancer; occupational history; and living conditions during adolescence was elicited by trained interviewers using a structured questionnaire. Included were 464 cases (90% of eligible) and 480 controls (87% of eligible). Among men, the risk of stomach cancer was significantly elevated among current smokers (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7) but not among former smokers. The excess risk was largely confined to long-term and heavy smokers, with significant 2-fold excess risk among men who smoked 40 or more pack-years. Among women, an 80% increase in risk was observed in both current and former smokers but dose-response trends were less consistent than among men. Alcohol consumption was not clearly related to risk, and no association was found for drinking regular coffee or herbal tea or using milk/cream in coffee or tea. A significant reduction in risk was linked to daily tea drinking among women, but not among men. Our findings confirm an association with cigarette smoking, which is estimated to account for approximately 20% of stomach cancers diagnosed among Warsaw residents during the study period.

[INST]  Identify all food items mentioned in the text:   One of the greatest challenges is to reduce malnutrition worldwide while promoting sustainable agricultural and food systems. This is a daunting task due to the constant growth of the population and the increasing demands by consumers for functional foods with higher nutritional values. Cereal grains are the most important dietary energy source globally; wheat, rice, and maize currently provide about half of the dietary energy source of humankind. In addition, the increase of celiac patients worldwide has motivated the development of gluten-free foods using alternative flour types to wheat such as rice, corn, cassava, soybean, and pseudocereals (amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat). Amaranth and quinoa have been cultivated since ancient times and were two of the major crops of the Pre-Colombian cultures in Latin- America. In recent years and due to their well-known high nutritional value and potential health benefits, these pseudocereals have received much attention as ideal candidates for gluten-free products. The importance of exploiting these grains for the elaboration of healthy and nutritious foods has forced food producers to develop novel adequate strategies for their processing. Fermentation is one of the most antique and economical methods of producing and preserving foods and can be easily employed for cereal processing. The nutritional and functional quality of pseudocereals can be improved by fermentation using Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). This review provides an overview on pseudocereal fermentation by LAB emphasizing the capacity of these bacteria to decrease antinutritional factors such as phytic acid, increase the functional value of phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, and produce nutritional ingredients such as B-group vitamins. The numerous beneficial effects of lactic fermentation of pseudocereals can be exploited to design novel and healthier foods or grain ingredients destined to general population and especially to patients with coeliac disease.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Wheat gluten has an immense impact on human nutrition as it largely determines the processing properties of wheat flour, and in particular the ability to make leavened breads, other baked products, pasta and noodles. However, there has been increasing interest in wheat gluten over the past two decades because of its well-established role in triggering coeliac disease, and its perceived role in other adverse reactions to wheat. The literature on wheat gluten is vast and extends back over two centuries, with most studies focusing on the structures of gluten proteins and their role in determining the functional properties of wheat flour and dough. This article provides a concise account of wheat gluten, focusing on properties, and features which are relevant to its role in triggering coeliac disease and, to a lesser extent, other gluten-related disorders. It includes descriptions of the biological role of the gluten proteins, the structures and relationships of gluten protein families, and the presence of related types of protein which may also contribute to functional properties and impacts on health. It therefore provides an understanding of the gluten protein system at the level required by those focusing on its impact on human health.

We prospectively evaluated the relation between egg consumption and cholesterol-intake and diabetes in 65 364 French disease-free women who responded to a validated diet history questionnaire in 1993. Egg consumption included hardboiled eggs and eggs consumed in an omelette or a mixed dish, and dietary cholesterol was estimated using a French nutrient database. Over 14 years of follow-up, 1803 incident diabetes cases were identified through self-reports, supplementary questionnaires and drug reimbursement information. Multivariable Cox regression models were adjusted for age, education, menopause, menopausal hormone therapy, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, BMI, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, fruit, vegetables, processed red meat, coffee and sugar and artificially sweetened beverages. No association was observed between egg consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes. When comparing women who consumed at least five eggs per week with non-consumers, the multivariable hazard ratio (HR) was found to be 1<U+00B7>00 (95 % CI 0<U+00B7>78, 1<U+00B7>29; across categories, P trend=0<U+00B7>11). Women in the highest quintile of dietary cholesterol had a 40 % higher rate of diabetes compared with those in the lowest quintile (HR 1<U+00B7>40; 95 % CI 1<U+00B7>19, 1<U+00B7>63; across quintiles, P trend<0<U+00B7>0001). A 100 mg increase of dietary cholesterol per 4184 kJ (or 1000 kcal) was associated with a 14 % increase in the risk of diabetes (HR 1<U+00B7>14; 95 % CI 1<U+00B7>02, 1<U+00B7>26). In this large prospective cohort, we observed an association between dietary cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, but no association with egg consumption.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms mentioned in the text:   Over one third of Australians' daily energy intake is from discretionary foods and drinks. While many health promotion efforts seek to limit discretionary food intake, the population health impact of reductions in the consumption of different types of discretionary foods (e.g., sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), confectionery, sweet biscuits) has not been quantified. This study estimated the potential reductions in body weight, obesity-related disease incidence, and healthcare cost savings associated with consumption of one less serving per week of different discretionary foods. Reductions in the different types of discretionary food were modelled individually to estimate the impact on energy consumption and population body weight by 5-year age and sex groups. It was assumed that one serving of discretionary food each week was replaced with either a serving of fruit or popcorn, and a serving (375 mL) of SSBs was replaced with coffee, tea, or milk. Proportional multi-state multiple-cohort Markov modelling estimated likely resultant health adjusted life years (HALYs) gained and healthcare costs saved over the lifetime of the 2010 Australian population. A reduction of one serving of SSBs (375 mL) had the greatest potential impact in terms of weight reduction, particularly in ages 19-24 years (mean 0.31 kg, 95% UI: 0.23 kg to 0.37 kg) and overall healthcare cost savings of AUD 793.4 million (95% UI: 589.1 M to 976.1 M). A decrease of one serving of sweet biscuits had the second largest potential impact on weight change overall, with healthcare cost savings of $640.7 M (95% CI: $402.6 M to $885.8 M) and the largest potential weight reduction amongst those aged 75 years and over (mean 0.21 kg, 95% UI: 0.14 kg to 0.27 kg). The results demonstrate that small reductions in discretionary food consumption are likely to have substantial health benefits at the population level. Moreover, the study highlights that policy responses to improve population diets may need to be tailored to target different types of foods for different population groups.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities within the text:   The glycemic index concept neglects the insulin secretion factor and has not been systematically studied during mixed meals. Six starch-rich foods were tested alone and in an isoglucido-lipido-protidic meal in 18 NIDDs and compared with a glucose challenge. These test meals were randomly assigned using a three factor experiment design. All three tests contained 50 g carbohydrate; mixed meals were adjusted to bring the same amount of fat (20 g), protein (24 g), water (300 mL), and calories (475 kcal) but not the same amount of fiber. Whatever the tested meals, foods elicited a growing glycemic index hierarchy from beans to lentils, rice, spaghetti, potato, and bread (mean range: 0.21 +/- 0.12-92 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.001). Mixing the meals significantly increased the insulinemic indexes (p less than 0.05) and introduced a positive correlation between glycemic and insulinemic indexes (n = 6, r = 0.903; p less than 0.05). The glycemic index concept remains discriminating, even in the context of an iso-glucido-lipido-protidic meal. Insulinemic indexes do not improve discrimination between foods taken alone in type 2 diabetics: they only discriminate between foods during mixed meals, similarly to glycemic indexes.

[INST]  Find all mentions of food-related entities in the text:   Nigeria is a multicultural country with a diverse cultural food. Most Nigerians' cultural diet is based on staple food accompanied by stew. In the South West and Eastern region (where Yorubas and Igbos are the dominant ethnic groups), staple foods are yam and cassava by-product (garri, fufu and lafun) with vegetables prepared as stew, often over cooked, thereby losing essential micronutrients. In Northern Nigeria (where the Hausas and Fulanis are the dominant ethnic groups), grains such as sorghum, millet form the main diet; these are served with palm oil based soup made with tomatoes and okra. Meat is sometimes added. Among the Hausas, meat is usually reserved for special occasions. Various types of malnutrition prevalent in developing countries such as Nigeria are iron deficiency anemia (ID/A), protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), iodine deficiency disorder (IDD). The proposed long-term measure by the Federal government of Nigeria for the resolution of these various types of malnutrition is dietary diversification.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related entities mentioned in the text:   Recent work by epidemiologists and microbiologists has uncovered several hitherto unrecognized food-borne bacterial pathogens of public health significance. One of these, Listeria monocytogenes, has attracted considerable attention because of two major cheese-related outbreaks of listeriosis that were characterized by cases of meningitis, abortion, and perinatal septicemia. Thus far, L. monocytogenes has been responsible for well over 300 reported cases of food-borne listeriosis, including about 100 deaths, and has cost the dairy industry alone more than 66 million dollars as a result of product recalls. The ability of L. monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures, coupled with appearance of the pathogen in raw and processed meats, as well as poultry, vegetables, and seafood, makes this bacterium a serious threat to susceptible consumers and to the entire food industry. Yersinia enterocolitica, another psychrotrophic food-borne pathogen of recent concern, was linked to several outbreaks of yersiniosis associated with consumption of both raw and pasteurized milk, as well as contaminated water. Food-borne infections involving Y. enterocolitica typically result in enterocolitis, which may be mistaken for acute appendicitis. Unfortunately, inadvertent removal of healthy appendixes from victims of food-borne yersiniosis is all too common. Although known for many years, Campylobacter jejuni has only recently been recognized as a food-borne pathogen and a leading cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. Notable outbreaks of campylobacteriosis linked to consumption of raw milk, cake icing, eggs, poultry, and beef have underscored the need for thorough cooking and proper handling of raw products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  [/INST] Of course, here are the entities related to food:  cheese, raw and processed meats, poultry, vegetables, seafood, raw and pasteurized milk, water, raw milk, cake icing, eggs, beef.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food-related terms in the text:   Work from our laboratory, as well as others, suggests a protective role of phytosterols (PS), especially beta-sitosterol, from colon, prostate, and breast cancer. Asians and vegetarians consume higher amounts of PS than Western societies. The latter societies have a higher incidence of these cancers than Asians and vegetarians. The aim of this study was to evaluate peanuts and its products as sources of PS in the American diet. Roasted peanuts contain 61-114 mg PS/100 g depending on the peanut variety, 78-83% of which is in the form of beta-sitosterol. Unrefined peanut oil contains 207 mg PS/100 g, which is similar to that of the US Department of Agriculture Nutrient Database. This value is higher than that of unrefined olive oil. Refining these oils results in reduction in PS concentration in the oil. This loss is greater in the case of olive oil than peanut oil. Further refining, such as deodorization, results in significant loss in PS, but hydrogenation after refining has a minimal effect on PS loss. Peanut butter, which represents 50% of the peanuts consumed in the United States, contains 144-157 mg PS/100 g. Peanut flour, which results from partial removal of oil from peanuts, contains 55-60 mg PS/100 g. The data suggest that peanuts and its products, such as peanut oil, peanut butter, and peanut flour, are good sources of PS.

[INST]  Extract all references to food items from the text:   It has been hypothesized that milk consumption increases the risk of ovarian cancer because of a possible association of lactose with human ovarian failure. Milk is also a source of animal fats in the diet, and animal fat intake is associated with ovarian cancer risk. To explore further the possible confounding of the milk-ovarian cancer association by the animal fat content of milk, the authors performed a case-control study of 303 ovarian cancer cases and 606 age-matched nonmalignant-disease controls seen between 1982 and 1988 at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, New York. Total frequency of usual milk intake was not associated with increased risk. Usually drinking more than one glass of whole milk daily relative to never drinking whole milk was associated with a relative risk of 3.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-5.5). Consumption of reduced-fat milk was associated with reduced relative risk. Among persons who reported drinking milk regularly, persons reporting drinking only whole milk were at increased risk (relative risk = 2.6, 95% CI 1.7-4.0) relative to persons who drank only skim milk or 2% milk. These findings suggest that milk-drinking is not a source of ovarian cancer risk independently of its fat content. Additional study of lactose and ovarian cancer risk involving careful control for confounding is needed.

[INST]  Extract all food-related mentions from the text:   Laboratory and animal studies suggest that dietary flavonols may reduce breast cancer risk but there are limited epidemiological studies. We computed flavonol intakes from dietary data collected by validated food frequency questionnaires in 1991 and 1995 from 90,630 women in the Nurses Health Study II. Using multivariate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), we evaluated the association of flavonol intake with breast cancer risk in women who were premenopausal and aged between 26 and 46 years at baseline in 1991. During 8 years of follow-up, we documented 710 cases of invasive breast cancer. The multivariate RR (95% CI), comparing highest to lowest quintiles of cumulative average intake, was 1.05 (0.83, 1.34; p-value for test of trend=0.96) for the sum of flavonols and there were no associations seen between individual flavonols such as kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin and breast cancer risk. The multivariate RR (95% CI), comparing highest to lowest quintiles of cumulative average intake, was 0.94 (0.72, 1.22; p-value for test of trend=0.54) for sum of flavonol-rich foods. Among the major food sources of flavonols, we found a significant inverse association with intake of beans or lentils but not with tea, onions, apples, string beans, broccoli, green pepper and blueberries. The multivariate RR (95% CI), comparing the highest category (2 or more times a week) of cumulative average beans or lentils intake with the lowest category (less than once a month), was 0.76 (0.57, 1.00; p-value for test of trend=0.03).

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food present in the text:   Manufacturing of dark chocolate and other cocoa-based products is a complex multistage process beginning with spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation driven in the postharvest period by different microorganisms derived from the environment. Cocobiota defined as the association of microbial species involved in cocoa bean fermentation may have considerable impact on the medicinal properties of cocoa products via various primary and secondary metabolites, whose presence in dark chocolate and other cocoa-derived products has to be taken into consideration when analyzing medicinal effects of cocoa. Metabolites of acetic acid and lactic acid bacteria, two major cocobiota members, are recently shown to have considerable antifungal and cholesterol-lowering activities and promote the formation of short chain fatty acids and mannitol, an important prebiotic capable of modifying gut microbiota. Penicillium citrinum, a major type of fungi identifiable in fermented cocoa beans, produces a thermostable alkaloid, Penicitrinine A, as well as lovastatin, compounds with antineoplastic and cholesterol-lowering abilities, respectively. Moreover, recent results suggest that bacterial and fungal metabolites produced by cocobiota have a significant anti-infective potential. Therefore, various metabolites produced by cocobiota can mimic some medicinal effects of dark chocolate and other cocoa-derived products previously attributed to cocoa flavonoids and methylxanthines and need to be thoroughly investigated in in vitro and in vivo systems.

Data from the North West Adelaide Health Study, a population-based cohort study undertaken in Australia, were used to assess this association among adults aged 50 years and above. In this specific study, 1182 adults (545 males, 45<U+00B7>9 %) had dietary data collected using a FFQ and also had BMD measurements taken using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Factor analysis with principal component method was applied to ascertain dietary patterns. Two distinct dietary patterns were identified. Pattern 1 ('prudent pattern') was characterised by high intake of fruits, vegetables, sugar, nut-based milk, fish, legumes and high-fibre bread. In contrast, pattern 2 ('Western pattern') was characterised by high levels of processed and red meat, snacks, takeaway foods, jam, beer, soft drinks, white bread, poultry, potato with fat, high-fat dairy products and eggs. Compared with the study participants in the first tertile (T1, lowest consumption) of the prudent pattern, participants in the third tertile (T3) had a lower prevalence of low BMD (prevalence ratio (PR)=0<U+00B7>52; 95 % CI 0<U+00B7>33, 0<U+00B7>83) after adjusting for socio-demographic, lifestyle and behavioural characteristics, chronic conditions and energy intake. Participants in T3 of the Western pattern had a higher prevalence of low BMD (PR=1<U+00B7>68; 95 % CI 1<U+00B7>02, 2<U+00B7>77) compared with those in T1.

The study included 192 CRC patients with available EORTC QLQ-C30 data before and 12<U+00A0>months post-surgery and food frequency questionnaire data at 12<U+00A0>months post-surgery. Principal component analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. Multivariate regression models assessed associations between dietary patterns and QoL changes over time. We identified four major dietary patterns: "Western" dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of potatoes, red and processed meat, poultry, and cakes, "fruit&vegetable" pattern: high intake of vegetables, fruits, vegetable oils, and soy products, "bread&butter" pattern: high intake of bread, butter and margarine, and "high-carb" pattern: high consumption of pasta, grains, nonalcoholic beverages, sauces and condiments.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   Garlic has long been the focus of experimental and clinical attentions due to its promising lipid-lowering effects. Numerous animal studies as well as in vitro ones have demonstrated the hypolipidemic effects of garlic, while clinical trials are highly inconsistent. Based on some double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials which denied the hypolipidemic effects of garlic, some meta-analysis concluded that garlic did not possess beneficial effects for hyperlipidemia. However, we should not ignore the abundant supporting data in the literature. It should be noted that the doses of garlic used in clinical trials were usually far lower than those used in animal studies, which might cover its potential effects. The type of the garlic products may be another important factor responsible for the conflicting outcomes, as different garlic products are composed of different organosulfur compounds. In addition, the biological availability of garlic products is of importance, which was omitted in many studies. Moreover, some studies indicated that different people might have a different response to garlic, and thus garlic may be more beneficial for some specific groups. Collectively, it may be inappropriate to draw a conclusion that garlic does not benefit for hyperlipidemia. Future studies with larger samples are needed to further clarify the effects of garlic used at higher but non-toxic doses on specific groups.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms present in the text:   Evidence from randomised controlled trials supports beneficial effects of total dairy products on body weight, fat and lean mass, but evidence on associations of dairy types with distributions of body fat and lean mass is limited. We aimed to investigate associations of total and different types of dairy products with markers of adiposity, and body fat and lean mass distribution. We evaluated cross-sectional data from 12 065 adults aged 30-65 years recruited to the Fenland Study between 2005 and 2015 in Cambridgeshire, UK. Diet was assessed with an FFQ. We estimated regression coefficients (or percentage differences) and their 95 % CI using multiple linear regression models. The medians of milk, yogurt and cheese consumption were 293 (interquartile range (IQR) 146-439), 35<U+00B7>3 (IQR 8<U+00B7>8-71<U+00B7>8) and 14<U+00B7>6 (IQR 4<U+00B7>8-26<U+00B7>9) g/d, respectively. Low-fat dairy consumption was inversely associated with visceral:subcutaneous fat ratio estimated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (-2<U+00B7>58 % (95 % CI -3<U+00B7>91, -1<U+00B7>23 %) per serving/d). Habitual consumption per serving/d (200 g) of milk was associated with 0<U+00B7>33 (95 % CI 0<U+00B7>19, 0<U+00B7>46) kg higher lean mass. Other associations were not significant after false discovery correction. Our findings suggest that the influence of milk consumption on lean mass and of low-fat dairy consumption on fat mass distribution may be potential pathways for the link between dairy consumption and metabolic risk. Our cross-sectional findings warrant further research in prospective and experimental studies in diverse populations.

[INST]  Identify all food-related entities present in the text:   The circulating insulin and glucose responses in type II diabetic subjects were determined for 5 h after ingestion of various meals, each containing 50 g carbohydrate. The purpose of the study was to 1) systematically study the insulin response to several different high-starch foods, 2) determine whether this insulin response could be predicted by the glucose response, and 3) determine whether the glucose response could be predicted by the physical structure and digestibility of the ingested carbohydrate. Each subject served as his own control. Carbohydrate was given in the form of potatoes, bread, oatmeal, rice, lentils, kidney beans, cornflakes, high-amylose corn muffins, and low-amylose corn muffins. Bread, oatmeal, rice, lentils, kidney beans, and high-amylose corn muffins resulted in a significantly lower glucose area than 50 g glucose, and the glucose response generally could be predicted by the physical structure and the known digestibility of the ingested carbohydrate. The insulin rise was statistically significantly greater than would be predicted from the glucose response for oatmeal, lentils, kidney beans, and high-amylose corn muffins. Although not statistically significant, the mean was greater than predicted for every other food except potatoes when the insulin response to 50 g glucose was used as a standard. These results indicate that the insulin response cannot be predicted by the glucose response.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms contained in the text:   Maternal nutrition can have a profound effect on fetal growth, development, and subsequent infant birth weight. Preconception dietary patterns have not been assessed in relation to perinatal outcomes. The objectives of this study were to identify associations between maternal dietary patterns in the 12 mo before conception on fetal growth and preterm delivery. Preconception food frequency data were collected retrospectively in 309 women. Dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis. Perinatal outcomes were collected at delivery with birth weight data calculated into percentiles to assess small and large for gestational age and preterm delivery at <37 wk. Three dietary patterns were identified: 1) high-protein/fruit (characterized by fish, meat, chicken, fruit, and some whole grains); 2) high-fat/sugar/takeaway (takeaway foods, potato chips, refined grains); and 3) vegetarian-type (vegetables, legumes, whole grains). A 1-SD increase in the scores on the high-protein/fruit pattern was associated with decreased likelihood of preterm birth (adjusted OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.72; P = 0.007), whereas the reverse direction was apparent for the high-fat/sugar/takeaway pattern (adjusted OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.15; P = 0.011). A 1-SD increase in the scores on the high fat/sugar/takeaway pattern was also associated with shorter gestation (adjusted regression coefficient: -2.7; 95% CI: -4.3, -1.1; P = 0.001) and birth length (adjusted regression coefficient: -0.5; 95% CI: -0.8, -0.1; P = 0.004). Nutrition before pregnancy is associated with perinatal outcomes. A dietary pattern containing several protein-rich food sources, fruit, and some whole grains is associated with reduced likelihood for preterm delivery, whereas a dietary pattern mainly consisting of discretionary items is associated with preterm delivery, shorter birth length, and earlier gestation. Poor dietary behaviors in the periconceptional period could be altered to promote behavior change in dietary intake to improve perinatal outcomes and the long-term health of the child.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities within the text:   Natural rubber latex allergy is responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from rhinoconjunctivitis to severe anaphylaxis, in both adults and children. An association between allergy to latex and allergy to various fruits has been reported. This study investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of latex sensitization in children seen in a university hospital allergy clinic. A total of 453 consecutive children were screened in a 7-month period. A detailed clinical history with particular attention to the past surgical history and the eventual presence of latex- or food-induced allergic symptoms was obtained. Skin prick tests (SPT) for the more important inhalant allergens and foods were performed on all children. In patients with positive latex SPT, latex challenge and additional SPT for some fresh foods (avocado, pineapple, apricot, grape, banana, pear, apple, orange, almond, and chestnut) were also performed. RAST for the same food antigens, as well as patch test with latex and a standard battery of contact allergens, was also done. Of 326 atopic children, 10 (3%) presented positive skin test to latex, but only five (1.5%) also had a positive clinical history to latex exposure. Latex challenge was positive in 3/9 positive-latex-SPT children. None of the nonatopic children had positive skin test to latex or symptoms to latex exposure. A history of previous surgery was found in 5/10 positive-latex-SPT children, in 63/316 negative-latex-SPT atopic children (P < 0.05), and in 23/127 nonatopic children. RAST to latex was positive in 5/10 positive-latex-SPT children. Associated fruit-specific IgE (SPT and/or RAST) were found in all latex-symptomatic children and in 2/5 latex-asymptomatic children. Apple, kiwi, and chestnut were the most common SPT-positive foods. Only one patient with clinical allergy to latex and positive skin tests to fruits had a history of clinical symptoms after ingestion of kiwi and orange. The natural history of the positive-latex-SPT children without clinical reactions to latex exposure and the clinical significance of the association of latex and fruit sensitivity require further studies.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms referenced in the text:   Mandatory folic acid fortification of wheat flour for making bread was implemented in Australia in September 2009, to improve the dietary folate status of women of child-bearing age, and help reduce the incidence of neural tube defects in the population. This paper presents estimates of folic acid intake in the target population and other subgroups of the Australian population following implementation of the mandatory folic acid fortification standard. In June/July 2010 one hundred samples from seven bread categories were purchased from around the country and individually analysed for the amount of folic acid they contained. A modification to the triple enzyme microbiological method was used to measure folic acid in the individual bread samples. The folic acid analytical values together with national food consumption data were used to generate estimates of the population's folic acid intake from fortified foods. Food Standards Australia New Zealand's (FSANZ) custom-built dietary modelling program (DIAMOND) was used for the estimates. The mean amount of folic acid found in white bread was 200<U+2009><U+03BC>g/100<U+2009>g which demonstrated that folic-acid-fortified wheat flour was used to bake the bread. The intake estimates indicated an increase in mean folic acid intake of 159<U+2009><U+03BC>g per day for the target group. Other sub-groups of the population also showed increases in estimated mean daily intake of folic acid.  [/INST] Definitely, the entities concerning food are:  wheat flour, bread, white bread.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics, antioxidative properties, and hepatoprotective effects of Maillard reaction products (MRP) from milk protein reacted with sugars. The MRP were obtained from milk protein, whey protein concentrates and sodium caseinate, using 2 types of sugars, lactose and glucose, by heating the mixture at 55<U+00B0>C for 7d in a sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Changes in the chemical modification of the milk protein were monitored by measuring the protein-bound carbonyls and PAGE protein profiles. The results showed that the amount of protein-bound carbonyls increased after Maillard reaction (MR). In addition, sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE analysis indicated a formation of high-molecular weight complexes through MR. The modification sites induced by MR of milk protein were monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic-digested gel spots of MRP. As a result, modification and their localization in AA sequence of MRP was identified. Also, the MRP showed higher antioxidant activities than the intact milk protein, and they reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species production and inhibited the depletion of the reduced glutathione concentrations in the HepG2 cells. In particular, glucose-sodium caseinate MRP showed the highest biological activities among all MRP. Therefore, these results suggest that the MRP from milk protein reacting with sugars possess effective antioxidant activity and have a protective ability against oxidative damage.

[INST]  Extract all food-related mentions from the text:   Metabolic alkalosis may develop as a consequence of urinary chloride (and sodium) wasting, excessive loss of salt in the sweat, or intestinal chloride wasting, among other causes. There is also a likely underrecognized association between poor salt intake and the mentioned electrolyte and acid-base abnormality. In patients with excessive loss of salt in the sweat or poor salt intake, the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis is crucially modulated by the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger pendrin located on the renal tubular membrane of type B intercalated cells. In the late 1970s, recommendations were made to decrease the salt content of foods as part of an effort to minimize the tendency towards systemic hypertension. Hence, the baby food industry decided to remove added salt from formula milk. Some weeks later, approximately 200 infants (fed exclusively with formula milks with a chloride content of only 2-4 mmol/L), were admitted with failure to thrive, constipation, food refusal, muscular weakness, and delayed psychomotor development. The laboratory work-up disclosed metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and a reduced urinary chloride excretion. In all cases, both the clinical and the laboratory features remitted in <U+2264>7 days when the infants were fed on formula milk with a normal chloride content. Since 1982, 13 further publications reported additional cases of dietary chloride depletion. It is therefore concluded that the dietary intake of chloride, which was previously considered a "mendicant" ion, plays a crucial role in acid-base and salt balance.

[INST]  Extract all food items listed in the text:   We review and compare trends in coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality in Spain from 1966 to 1990 and changes in food consumption at national and regional levels. Since 1976, a decrease in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in males and females has been observed, and standardized CHD mortality rates have fallen. Stroke mortality decreased during the same period. Trends in food consumption show increases in intakes of meat, dairy products, fish, and fruit, but decreases in consumption of olive oil, sugar, and all foods rich in carbohydrates. Although fat and saturated fat intakes increased, these changes were not accompanied by an increase in CHD mortality rates. This paradoxical situation can be explained by expanded access to clinical care, increased consumption of fruit and fish, improved control of hypertension, and a reduction in cigarette smoking. Diet appears to have an important role in this paradox, but it may not be as critical as other factors. Nevertheless, we suggest dietary guidelines for prevention of CHD in Spain.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms present in the text:   We present a food pyramid that reflects Mediterranean dietary traditions, which historically have been associated with good health. This Mediterranean diet pyramid is based on food patterns typical of Crete, much of the rest of Greece, and southern Italy in the early 1960s, where adult life expectancy was among the highest in the world and rates of coronary heart disease, certain cancers, and other diet-related chronic diseases were among the lowest. Work in the field or kitchen resulted in a lifestyle that included regular physical activity and was associated with low rates of obesity. The diet is characterized by abundant plant foods (fruit, vegetables, breads, other forms of cereals, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds), fresh fruit as the typical daily dessert, olive oil as the principal source of fat, dairy products (principally cheese and yogurt), and fish and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts, zero to four eggs consumed weekly, red meat consumed in low amounts, and wine consumed in low to moderate amounts, normally with meals. This diet is low in saturated fat (< or = 7-8% of energy), with total fat ranging from < 25% to > 35% of energy throughout the region. The pyramid describes a dietary pattern that is attractive for its famous palatability as well as for its health benefits.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Consumption of beef, pork, and lamb has traditionally been low in Mediterranean countries. Regular consumption of red meat has been associated in epidemiologic studies with increased risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and colon and other cancers; possible mechanisms may involve dietary cholesterol, saturated fat, heme iron, and the presence of carcinogens formed in cooking. Also, high consumption of red meat, the major source of animal protein in most Western diets, increases urinary calcium losses and is therefore likely to contribute to osteoporotic fractures. In Mediterranean diets the major source of dietary fat has traditionally been olive oil, which, compared with saturated and partially hydrogenated fats, reduces low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and, compared with carbohydrates, increases high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A wealth of epidemiologic evidence supports a potent protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption against CHD, probably in part by increasing HDL concentrations. Although dietary factors alone may not fully explain the excellent health of Mediterranean populations, available evidence strongly suggests important contributions of high consumption of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains; moderate intake of alcohol; and low consumption of animal products, saturated and hydrogenated fats, and refined carbohydrates.

[INST]  Extract all food items from the text:   Predictions of drug residues in milk are critical in food protection and are a major consideration in the economics of treatment of mastitis in dairy cows. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NLME) has been advocated as a suitable pharmaco-statistical method for the study of drug residues in milk. Recent developments in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of intramammary drugs allow the combination of a mechanistic description of milk pharmacokinetics with NLME methods. The PBPK model was applied to NLME analysis of a data set consisting of milk drug concentrations from 78 healthy cows and 117 with clinical mastitis. Pirlimycin milk pharmacokinetics were adequately described by the model across the range of observed concentrations. Mastitis was characterized by increased variance in milk production volume. Udder residual volume was larger in cows with 1, or 2 or greater diseased mammary glands than in the healthy cows. Low-producing cows had a greater risk of prolonged milk residues. With the exclusion of the low-production cows, the model predicted that healthy cows required a milk discard time 12 h longer than that indicated by the label, and the diseased cows 36 h longer than indicated by the label. More pirlimycin was systemically absorbed in the gram-positive infected compared with the gram-negative infected or healthy cows, suggesting a greater risk of violative meat residues in gram-positive infected cows. Using NLME and PBPK models, we identified factors associated with changes in pirlimycin milk residues that may affect food safety. This model extends the verification of a simple physiologically based framework for the study of intramammary drugs.  [/INST] Yes, the entities pertaining to food are outlined below:  milk.

We hypothesized that dietary factors associated with breast cancer risk might differentially influence the HER-2 status of the cancers that develop, and investigated this hypothesis by analyzing the data of the ORDET prospective study. We analyzed 8,861 volunteer women residents of the Varese Province, Italy, for whom we had full data. By December 31, 2001, 238 cases had occurred in which HER-2 status was known. Four dietary patterns had been identified previously by factor analysis: salad vegetables (high consumption of raw vegetables and olive oil), prudent (cooked vegetables, poultry, fish), western (potatoes, meat, eggs, butter), and canteen (pasta, tomato sauce, wine). In our study, relative risks (RRs) of developing HER-2-positive and HER-2-negative breast cancers by tertiles of dietary pattern factor scores were assessed by multinomial logistic regression. The salad vegetables dietary pattern had a protective effect against HER-2-positive cancers (RR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.64, for the highest tertile; p(trend) = 0.001), much stronger than for HER-2-negative cancers (p(heterogeneity) = 0.039). This important finding that a salad vegetables dietary pattern protects mainly against a specific breast cancer subtype indicates that future studies on environmental/dietary risk factors should explicitly take account of the heterogeneity of breast cancer phenotypes.

[INST]  Extract all food-related terms listed in the text:   A dietary survey was carried out in Mazanderan Province of the Caspian Littoral of Iran. The inhabitants of this province have the highest rate of esophageal cancer in the world. A total of 1,501 individuals, in 197 households, from 35 villages in different regions were studied. These regions, which were based on the staple food of the region, included the low-to-moderate risk areas of Shahsavar and Babol in central and western Mazanderan, where the staple diet is rice, and the high- and moderately high-risk areas of Turkoman Sahara (Gonbad and Gorgan) in the east, where the main food is local bread. Perhaps because of poverty and simplicity of the local dishes in the high-risk region, the inhabitants of Turkoman Sahara eat their food three to four times faster than do the people in the moderate- and low-risk regions. In this high-risk area, where the frequency of esophageal cancer is higher among females than among males, a special diet known as "majoweh" or "majum" is given to pregnant women. This food is a crushed mixture of sour pomegranate seeds, black pepper, dried raisins, and occasionally garlic; this combination irritates the esophagus because of the hot black pepper and the sharp, crushed pomegranate seeds. People in the high-risk region preserve their meat by sun drying, and a higher proportion of households in this region keep the preserved food for longer periods of time. Also, the inhabitants of the high-risk region drink more tea at a much higher temperature. Very little fruit and vegetables are consumed by the Turkomans of the high-risk region, whereas inhabitants in the low-risk area keep vegetables and citrus fruits as an important part of their usual diets.

[INST]  Identify all food entities mentioned in the text:   Industrial and municipal solid wastes, noise, pesticides, fertilizers and vehicular emission are visible pollutants responsible for environmental contamination and ill-effects on health of all living systems. But, environmental contamination due to drugs or medicines used for different purposes in humans and animals goes unseen largely and can affect the health of living system severely. During the last few decades, the usage of drugs has increased drastically, resulting in increased drug load in soil and water. Contraceptive and fertility drugs are extensively and effectively used in humans as well as animals for different purposes. Usage of these reproductive drugs in humans is increased manifold to manage reproductive problems and/or for birth control with changing lifestyles. These drugs are excreted in urine and faeces as metabolite or conjugated forms, leading to contamination of water, milk and animal produce, which are consumed directly by humans as well as animals. These drugs are not eliminated even by water treatment plant. Consumption of such contaminated water, milk, meat and poultry products results in reproductive disorders such as fertility loss in men and increase risk of different types of cancers in humans. Therefore, assessment of impact of environmental contamination by these drugs on living system is of paramount importance. The purpose of this review article is to provide a comprehensive analysis of various research and review reports on different contraceptive and fertility drugs used in human and animals, their occurrence in the environment and their ill-effects on living systems.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items referenced in the text:   In an international comparison of recent mortality statistics among G7 countries, Japan had the longest average life expectancy, primarily due to remarkably low mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and cancer (particularly breast and prostate). As recently as the 1960s, life expectancy in Japan was the shortest among the G7 countries, owing to relatively high mortality from cerebrovascular disease-particularly intracerebral hemorrhage-and stomach cancer. Mortality rates for these diseases subsequently decreased significantly while the already low rates for ischemic heart disease and cancer also decreased, resulting in Japanese life expectancy becoming the longest. The low mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and cancer are thought to reflect the low prevalence of obesity in Japan; low intake of red meat, specifically saturated fatty acids; and high intakes of fish, specifically n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, plant foods such as soybeans, and nonsugar-sweetened beverages such as green tea. The decreasing mortality rates from cerebrovascular disease are thought to reflect the increases in animal foods, milk, and dairy products and consequently in saturated fatty acids and calcium, together with a decrease in salt intake which may have led to a decrease in blood pressure. This decrease in salt and highly salted foods also seems to account for the decrease in stomach cancer. The typical Japanese diet as characterized by plant food and fish as well as modest Westernized diet such as meat, milk and dairy products might be associated with longevity in Japan.

We examined the association of tea and coffee consumption with EC risk among 442,143 men and women without cancer at baseline from 9 countries of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Tea and coffee intakes were recorded using country-specific validated dietary questionnaires. Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationships between tea and coffee intake and EC risk. During a mean follow-up of 11.1 years, 339 participants developed EC, of which 142 were esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and 174 were esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In the multivariable models, no significant associations between tea (mostly black tea), and coffee intake and risk of EC, EAC and ESCC were observed. In stratified analyses, among men coffee consumption was inversely related to ESCC (HR for comparison of extreme tertiles 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.88; p-trend=0.022), but not among women. In current smokers, a significant and inverse association was observed between ESCC risk and tea (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.93; p-trend=0.053) and coffee consumption (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.73; p-trend=0.011). However, no statistically significant findings were observed using the continuous variable (per 100 mL/d).

[INST]  Extract all food entities present in the text:   Ovarian cancer is commonly a fatal disease and, despite advances in screening and treatment, the lack of understanding of the underlying etiology has limited prevention strategies. This article reviews the epidemiologic literature on the relationship between consumption of major food groups and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We identified 7 cohort studies and 27 case-control studies of consumption of major food groups (fruits and vegetables, meats, eggs, fish, dairy products, grains, fats and oils) and EOC risk. Vegetable but not fruit consumption was found to possibly exhibit beneficial effects on the risk of EOC, whereas high meat consumption may be associated with an increased risk. A protective effect on risk of EOC for whole-grain food consumption as well as for consumption of low-fat milk is suggested by the results of the studies. However, evidence for associations of foods such as fish, grains, milk products, and fats and oils with EOC risk is limited and inconsistent, and further examination of these dietary determinants of EOC are warranted. In conclusion, a typical Western diet, which is high in meats and low in vegetables, may be positively associated with ovarian cancer incidence. However, the association between specific dietary factors and EOC risk remains unclear and merits further examination. In particular, future studies need to address the effect of milk products according to fat content and possible biological mechanisms to explain observed effects.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a common subtype of breast cancer among women with dense breasts and is associated with a poor prognosis. Diet is a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer, but the association between the risk of TNBC and diet has not been studied. The present study investigated the hypothesis that a healthy dietary pattern was negatively associated with risk of TNBC in women with dense breasts (density types 3 and 4). After total mastectomy or breast conserving surgery, patients with TNBC (n = 38) and non-TNBC (n = 178) were recruited. The risk of TNBC was negatively associated with a healthy dietary pattern involving consumption of seafood and vegetables, and positively associated with a dietary pattern of consuming grains, meats, and eggs. Additionally, intake of animal fat, eggs, and meat was positively associated with the risk of TNBC, but intake of vegetable fats, nuts, and vegetables showed a negative association. Patients with TNBC had higher proportion of obesity or abdominal obesity than those with non-TNBC. The present study is the first to show a negative association between risk of TNBC and a healthy dietary pattern in women with dense breasts and suggests the importance of diet in the prevention of TNBC.

We evaluated the consumption of coffee and other beverages and food containing caffeine in relation to the incidence of diabetes. The study participants were 5897 men and 7643 women in a community-based cohort in Takayama, Japan. Consumption of coffee, green tea, oolong tea, black tea and chocolate snacks were measured with a semi-quantitative FFQ in 1992. At the follow-up survey in 2002, the development of diabetes and the time of diagnosis were reported. To assess the association, age, smoking status, BMI, physical activity, education in years, alcohol consumption, total energy intake, fat intake and women's menopausal status were adjusted. Among men who consumed one cup per month to six cups per week and among those who consumed one cup per d or more, the associated hazard ratios were 0.69 (95 % CI 0.50, 0.97) and 0.69 (95 % CI 0.49, 0.98) compared with those who drank little to no coffee, with a P value for trend of 0.32. The hazard ratios for women with the same coffee consumption patterns were 1.08 (95 % CI 0.74, 1.60) and 0.70 (95 % CI 0.44, 1.12), with a P value for trend of 0.03. The association between estimated total caffeine intake and risk of diabetes was insignificant both among men and among women. The results imply that coffee consumption decreased the risk of developing diabetes. The protective effect may exist aside from the influence of caffeine intake.

Consistent positive associations were observed with more frequent consumption of bread (odds ratio, OR = 2.1 for colon and 2.2 for rectum for highest vs. lowest tertile), polenta (OR = 2.1 for colon, 1.9 for rectum), cheese (OR = 1.7 for colon, 1.8 for rectum) and eggs (2.5 for colon, 1.9 for rectum), whereas reduced ORs were observed in subjects reporting more frequent consumption of tomatoes (OR = 0.5 for colon and 0.4 for rectum). High consumption of margarine exerted a significant protection against cancer of the colon whereas high consumption of carrot spinach, whole-grain bread and pasta (favorably) and red meat (unfavorably) affected rectal cancer risk in particular.

We conducted a study to investigate whether milk and fermented milk intakes are associated with incident PD. This cohort study included 81,915 Swedish adults (with a mean age of 62 years) who completed a questionnaire, including questions about milk and fermented milk (soured milk and yogurt) intake, in 1997. PD cases were identified through linkage with the Swedish National Patient and Cause of Death Registers. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were obtained from Cox proportional hazards regression models. During a mean follow-up of 14.9 years, 1251 PD cases were identified in the cohort. Compared with no or low milk consumption (<40 mL/day), the hazard ratios of PD across quintiles of milk intake were 1.29 (95% CI 1.07, 1.56) for 40-159 mL/day, 1.19 (95% CI 0.99, 1.42) for 160-200 mL/day, 1.29 (95% CI 1.08, 1.53) for 201-400 mL/day, and 1.14 (95% CI 0.93, 1.40) for >400 mL/day.

[INST]  Extract all references to food items from the text:   The term "Mediterranean diet," implying that all Mediterranean people have the same diet, is a misnomer. The countries around the Mediterranean basin have different diets, religions and cultures. Their diets differ in the amount of total fat, olive oil, type of meat and wine intake; milk vs. cheese; fruits and vegetables; and the rates of coronary heart disease and cancer, with the lower death rates and longer life expectancy occurring in Greece. Extensive studies on the traditional diet of Greece (the diet before 1960) indicate that the dietary pattern of Greeks consists of a high intake of fruits, vegetables (particularly wild plants), nuts and cereals mostly in the form of sourdough bread rather than pasta; more olive oil and olives; less milk but more cheese; more fish; less meat; and moderate amounts of wine, more so than other Mediterranean countries. Analyses of the dietary pattern of the diet of Crete shows a number of protective substances, such as selenium, glutathione, a balanced ratio of (n-6):(n-3) essential fatty acids (EFA), high amounts of fiber, antioxidants (especially resveratrol from wine and polyphenols from olive oil), vitamins E and C, some of which have been shown to be associated with lower risk of cancer, including cancer of the breast.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items referenced in the text:   Emerging literature suggests that diet plays an important modulatory role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because diet is an environmental factor that affects inflammation, antigen presentation, antioxidant defense mechanisms and gut microbiota. Patients with RA frequently ask their doctors about which diets to follow, and even in the absence of advice from their physicians, many patients are undertaking various dietary interventions. Given this background, the aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence to date regarding the ideal dietary approach for management of RA in order to reduce the counteracting inflammation, and to construct a food pyramid for patients with RA. The pyramid shows that carbohydrates should be consumed every day (3 portions of whole grains, preferably gluten free), together with fruits and vegetables (5 portions; among which fruit, berries and citrus fruit are to be preferred, and among the vegetables, green leafy ones.), light yogurt (125<U+00A0>ml), skim milk (200<U+00A0>ml), 1 glass (125<U+00A0>ml) of wine and extra virgin olive oil; weekly, fish (3 portions), white meat (3 portions), legumes (2 portions) eggs (2 portions), seasoned cheeses (2 portions), and red or processed meats (once a week). At the top of the pyramid, there are two pennants: one green means that subjects with RA need some personalized supplementation (vitamin D and omega 3) and one red means that there are some foods that are banned (salt and sugar). The food pyramid allows patients to easily figure out what to eat.

[INST]  Identify all food items referenced in the text:   The current study aimed to investigate the role of cooking with mustard oil and other dietary factors in relation to gallbladder cancer (GBC) in high- and low-incidence regions of India. A case-control study was conducted including 1,170 histologically confirmed cases and 2,525 group-matched visitor controls from the largest cancer hospital in India. Dietary data were collected through a food frequency questionnaire. For oil consumption, we enquired about monthly consumption of 11 different types of cooking oil per family and the number of individuals usually sharing the meal to estimate per-individual consumption of oil. Information about method of cooking was also requested. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) quantifying the association of GBC risk consumption of different types of oil, method of cooking, and dietary food items, were estimated using logistic regression models, after adjusting for potential confounders. High consumption of mustard oil was associated with GBC risk in both high- and low-risk regions (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.99-1.78; OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.66-5.45), respectively. An increased risk of GBC was observed with deep frying of fresh fish in mustard oil (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 0.99-2.47, p-value = 0.052). A protective association was observed with consumption of leafy vegetables, fruits, onion and garlic. No association was observed between consumption of meat, spicy food, turmeric, pulses or with any other oil as a cooking medium. The effect of high consumption of mustard oil on GBC risk, if confirmed, has implications for the primary prevention of GBC, via a reduced consumption.

[INST]  Extract all food entities present in the text:   The bioaccessibility of fat has implications for satiety and postprandial lipidaemia. The prevailing view holds that the integrity of plant cell wall structure is the primary determinant of energy and nutrient extraction from plant cells as they pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, comparisons across nuts (walnuts, almonds and pistachios) with varying physical properties do not support this view. In the present study, masticated samples of three nuts from healthy adults were exposed to a static model of gastric digestion followed by simulated intestinal digestion. Primary outcomes were particle size and lipid release at each phase of digestion. Walnuts produced a significantly larger particle size post-mastication compared with almonds. Under gastric and intestinal conditions, the particle size was larger for walnuts compared with pistachios and almonds (P < 0<U+00B7>05). However, the masticated and digesta particle sizes were not related to the integrity of cell walls or lipid release. The total lipid release was comparable between nuts after the in vitro intestinal phase (P > 0<U+00B7>05). Microstructural examination showed ruptured and fissured cell walls that would allow digestion of cellular contents, and this may be governed by internal cellular properties such as oil body state. Furthermore, the cell walls of walnuts tend to rupture rather than separate and as walnut tissue passes through the GI tract, lipids tend to coalesce reducing digestion efficiency.

Evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies suggests a protective effect against the development of coronary heart disease with moderate consumption of wine and especially red wine. The exact nature of the protective effect remains to be established. However, mechanisms including low-density lipoproteins oxidation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, modification of eicosanoid metabolism, and endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels are recognized as contributory. In this study, a new approach has been examined, based on previous reports that platelet-activating factor (PAF) is involved in atherogenesis. An attempt was made to detect key components in wine/must that through inhibition of PAF action may contribute to the protective role of white wine/must against atherosclerosis. More specifically, polar lipids from four wines and three musts were fractionated by thin-layer chromatography, and fractions were tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit PAF and thrombin-induced washed rabbit platelet aggregation and/or to cause platelet aggregation. On the basis of the above results, a white wine from the principal Greek grape Rompola and its respective must with and without extra yeast were chosen for further high-performance liquid chromatography separation. A significant number of biological active lipids were detected, and structural data for the most active lipids are provided.

However, the extent to which food intake varies according to salt, fat and sugar content is imperfectly known. The present study aimed at evaluating whether toddler food intake varied during lunches or snacks in which salt, fat or sugar contents had been modified in common foods. Seventy-four children (30 (se 0<U+00B7>5) months old) participated in the study in their usual day-care centres. Every other week, they were served lunches composed, among other items, of green beans and pasta with varying salt (0, 0<U+00B7>6 and 1<U+00B7>2<U+00A0>% added salt) or fat (0, 2<U+00B7>5 and 5<U+00A0>% added butter) levels and afternoon snacks composed of fruit pur<U+00E9>e varying in sugar level (0, 5 and 10<U+00A0>% added sugar). During each meal, children could eat as much as they wanted from the target foods. Each food was weighed before and after the meal. Salt level had a positive impact on the intake of the target foods. On the contrary, no impact of added fat or added sugar levels was observed. This implies that fat and sugar addition could be avoided in foods for children without having an impact on palatability, allowing the energy density of children's diet to be limited. Salt addition should be limited, but its suppression in vegetables, whose intake is to be promoted, should be considered cautiously.

[INST]  Locate all food-related entities present in the text:   Levels of specific serum IgE to cow's milk, whole hen's egg, egg white, and egg yolk were compared to the outcome of double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with fresh egg and/or milk in 21 adults with a case history of immediate hypersensitivity to egg and/or milk. Specific serum IgE was measured by four different commercially available tests and by an inhouse Maxisorp RAST using freshly prepared food extracts. Sensitivities and negative predictive accuracies were generally high with egg white and milk, but low with egg yolk. Specificities and positive predictive accuracies were low for all allergens and tests. Changing the cutoff levels did not improve the ability of the tests to predict clinical allergy. Among commercially available test allergens, egg white gave the most consistent results in levels and class scores, and the highest degree of concordance with DBPCFC, whereas egg yolk and milk varied more. Applying freshly prepared food extracts in Maxisorp RAST did not improve diagnostic value. Measuring specific serum IgE levels in control subjects tolerant to egg/milk showed that false positive reactions occurred frequently among patients with another food allergy and atopic dermatitis, whereas most tests were likely to be negative in pollen-allergic and nonallergic volunteers. In conclusion, specific IgE measurements with egg white and milk were useful for exclusion of symptomatic hypersensitivity to egg and milk in patients with a positive history, whereas DBPCFC is still mandatory in patients with positive history and positive test. Measuring egg-yolk-specific IgE or using freshly prepared food extracts for specific IgE measurements added no further diagnostic information. The rate of clinically insignificant positive test results seems to be influenced by the prevalence of other food allergies and/or atopic dermatitis in the population under study.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items listed in the text:   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes. A vegetarian diet is defined as one that does not include meat (including fowl) or seafood, or products containing those foods. This article reviews the current data related to key nutrients for vegetarians including protein, n-3 fatty acids, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, and vitamins D and B-12. A vegetarian diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients. In some cases, supplements or fortified foods can provide useful amounts of important nutrients. An evidence- based review showed that vegetarian diets can be nutritionally adequate in pregnancy and result in positive maternal and infant health outcomes. The results of an evidence-based review showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease. Vegetarians also appear to have lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates. Features of a vegetarian diet that may reduce risk of chronic disease include lower intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol and higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy products, fiber, and phytochemicals. The variability of dietary practices among vegetarians makes individual assessment of dietary adequacy essential. In addition to assessing dietary adequacy, food and nutrition professionals can also play key roles in educating vegetarians about sources of specific nutrients, food purchase and preparation, and dietary modifications to meet their needs.

[INST]  Extract all references to food items from the text:   Wine may cause stomach irritation due to its stimulatory effect on gastric acid secretion, although the mechanisms by which wine or components thereof activate pathways of gastric acid secretion are poorly understood. Gastric pH was measured with a noninvasive intragastric probe, demonstrating that administration of 125 mL of white or red wine to healthy volunteers stimulated gastric acid secretion more potently than the administration of equivalent amounts of ethanol. Between both beverages, red wine showed a clear trend for being more active in stimulating gastric acid secretion than white wine (p = 0.054). Quantification of the intracellular proton concentration in human gastric tumor cells (HGT-1), a well-established indicator of proton secretion and, in turn, stomach acid formation in vivo, confirmed the stronger effect of red wine as compared to white wine. RT-qPCR experiments on cells exposed to red wine also revealed a more pronounced effect than white wine on the fold change expression of genes associated with gastric acid secretion. Of the quantitatively abundant organic acids in wine, malic acid and succinic acid most actively stimulated proton secretion in vitro. However, addition of ethanol to individual organic acids attenuated the secretory effect of tartaric acid, but not that of the other organic acids. It was concluded that malic acid for white wine and succinic acid for red wine are key organic acids that contribute to gastric acid stimulation.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   Dietary fibre has been shown to have important health implications in the prevention of risks of chronic diseases. The objective of the present study was to determine the potential health benefits of legumes as a good source of dietary fibre. Six to ten local legumes were studied as follows: cowpeas, mung beans, pole sitao, chickpeas, green peas, groundnuts, pigeon peas, kidney beans, lima beans and soyabeans. The following studies were conducted: (a) mineral availability, in vitro; (b) glycaemic index (GI) in non-diabetic and diabetic human subjects; (c) the cholesterol-lowering effect in human subjects with moderately raised serum cholesterol levels. The highest Fe availability among legumes was for lima beans (9.5 (sem 0.1)) while for Zn and Ca, the highest availability was for kidney beans (49.3 (sem 4.5)) and pigeon peas (75.1 (sem 7.1)), respectively. Groundnuts have the lowest Fe (1.3 (sem 1.1)), Zn (7.9 (sem 1.3)) and Ca (14.6 (sem 2.8)) availability. Legumes are low-GI foods ( < 55), ranging from 6 (chickpeas) to 13 (mung beans). Kidney beans showed significant reductions for both total (6 %) and LDL-cholesterol (9 %), and groundnuts for total cholesterol (7 %; P < 0.05). We conclude that mineral availability from legumes differs and may be attributed to their mineral content, mineral-mineral interaction and from their phytic and tannic acid content; legumes are considered low-GI foods and have shown potential hypocholesterolaemic effects. The above studies can be a scientific basis for considering legumes as functional foods.

Rats were made moderately anemic (Hb 7.8 +/- 0.7 g/dL) by feeding an iron-deficient diet and were then fed one of the 16 experimental diets. Test meals (100 micrograms Fe) labeled with 59Fe were fed after 5 d and 59Fe absorption determined by whole-body counting. Rats were killed after 5 wk and liver Fe, final Hb and delta Hb were determined. Nonheme iron was better absorbed than heme iron regardless of other dietary factors. Both heme iron absorption and nonheme iron absorption were higher when high (30%) rather than low (5%) dietary fat was fed. The type of fat had no effect. Rats fed both nonheme and heme iron had significantly higher Hb, delta Hb and liver iron when fed coconut oil, compared to safflower oil. Rats fed nonheme iron had higher liver Fe, but not Hb or delta Hb, when fed high rather than low dietary fat. Rats fed heme iron had higher Hb, delta Hb and liver Fe when fed high fat than low fat.

In this study, scalp hair analysis was used for the assessment of exposure to these metals in the industrial city of Taranto, characterized by a severe environmental pollution. The highest median values were observed for aluminum, barium, cadmium, lead, mercury, and uranium. Moreover, in the industrial area of Taranto, high levels of barium, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel, and silver were observed in comparison with other Apulia areas. The risk odds ratios (ORs) for observing values above the 50th percentile were elevated for mercury and fish consumption, uranium and milk consumption, lead and female sex, and aluminum and mineral water consumption. No significant increased risk was observed for occupational activities. In a dendrogram of a cluster analysis, three clusters were observed for the different areas of Taranto (Borgo, San Vito, and Statte). A scree plot and score variables plot underline the presence of two principal components: the first regarding antimony, lead, tin, aluminum and silver; the second regarding mercury and uranium. The observed clusters (Borgo, San Vito, and Statte) showed that lead, antimony, tin, aluminum, and silver were the main component. The highest values above the 50th percentile of these minerals, especially lead, were observed in the Borgo area. The observed metal concentration in the Borgo area is compatible with the presence in Taranto of a military dockyard and a reported increase of lung cancer risk among residents of that area.

Gingerols, the major pungent components of ginger, are known to improve diabetes, including the effect of enhancement against insulin sensitivity. In the current study, ginger sequentially extracted with different solvents-namely, hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, 70% methanol-water and water-were screened to determine the variations in phenolic-linked active constituents. The potential of these extracts to inhibit key enzymes relevant to type 2 diabetes and inflammation was studied. Phenolic compounds-namely, gingerols and shoagols-were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Ethyl acetate extract showed higher activity compared with other extracts. These studies indicate that ginger has very good potential for <U+03B1>-glucosidase and <U+03B1>-amylase inhibition relevant for type 2 diabetes management and cyclooxygenase inhibition for inflammation.

[INST]  Extract all food items from the text:   Because the Korean rice cake, Seolgitteok, is mainly prepared with rice flour containing no gluten-protein associated with celiac disease, it can be considered for inclusion in a gluten-free diet. However, Western consumers may be unlikely to enjoy the plain flavor and chewy texture of Seolgitteok. This study aimed to determine both sensory and nonsensory factors that might affect U.S. consumers' acceptability of Seolgitteok. A total of 119 U.S. consumers rated 5 Seolgitteok samples, differentiated by descriptive sensory analysis, with respect to hedonic impression and just-about-right aspects of sensory attributes. Nonsensory factors such as demographic profile, innovativeness, social representation, sensation-seeking, and personality traits were also assessed. Addition levels of brown rice flour (0% to 100%) and sugar (5% to 20%) not only enriched flavor, but also lessened chewiness of Seolgitteok, thereby increasing an overall hedonic impression. Moreover, consumer acceptability of Seolgitteok varied with respect to nonsensory factors. Seolgitteok was more appreciated by males, sensation seekers, and individuals constrained by social desirability than by other groups. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that U.S. consumers' acceptability of Seolgitteok varies not only by sensory attributes such as rice flavor, sweetness, and chewiness, but also by nonsensory factors such as gender, sensation-seeking characteristics, and personality traits.

[INST]  Extract all mentions of food from the text:   Reduced-fat food products can help to prevent obesity and other diet-related diseases. However, the removal of fat often impairs the sensory and textural properties of foods, leading to low consumer acceptance. In this study, we tested various concentrations of fat replacers (inulin, corn dextrin, polydextrose, and microparticulated whey protein) combined with rennet casein to investigate their effects on the melting behavior, dynamic rheological properties, and hardness of reduced-fat processed cheese. We found that increasing concentrations of inulin and corn dextrin reduced the flowability of cheese in the melting test and can thus be used to inhibit flow during heating. Microparticulated whey protein did not affect flowability but caused an increase in the storage and loss moduli as well as the temperature at gel-sol transition. A similar effect was also shown for rennet casein, whereas inulin and polydextrose had little or no effect on these rheological parameters. Corn dextrin had no effect on the storage and loss moduli, but affected the gel-sol transition temperature. No changes in hardness were detected for any concentration of the fat replacers, but increasing the rennet casein content also increased the hardness of the samples, regardless of the fat replacer used. Our results indicate the different concentrations and combinations of fat replacers and rennet casein that can be included in reduced-fat processed cheese to develop products with specific rheological properties, thus meeting future demand for reduced-fat products with attractive sensory attributes.

We analyzed two-day food consumption records from 1526 young children (10-48 months old) attending 199 daycare centers across The Netherlands. Data were observed and recorded in diaries by caregivers at the day nursery and by parents at home on days that the children attended the daycare center. According to national and European reference values, the children had an adequate nutrient intake with exception of low intakes of total fat, n-3 fatty acids from fish and possibly iron. Intakes of energy and protein were substantially higher than recommended and part of the population exceeded the tolerable upper intake levels for sodium, zinc and retinol. Consumption of fruit, fats, fish, and fluids was substantially less than recommended. The children used mostly (semi-)skimmed milk products and non-refined bread and cereals, as recommended. Two thirds of the consumed beverages, however, contained sugar and contributed substantially to energy intake. In young children, low intakes of n-3 fatty acids and iron are a potential matter of concern, as are the high intakes of energy, protein, sugared beverages, and milk, since these may increase the risk of becoming overweight.

A human intervention study with carrot and tomato juice should show whether a diet rich in carotenoids, especially high in beta-carotene and lycopene, can modify luminal processes relevant to colon carcinogenesis. In a randomised cross-over trial, twenty-two healthy young men on a low-carotenoid diet consumed 330 ml tomato or carrot juice per d for 2 weeks. Intervention periods were preceded by 2-week depletion phases. At the end of each study period, faeces of twelve volunteers were collected for chemical analyses and use in cell-culture systems. Consumption of carrot juice led to a marked increase of beta-carotene and alpha-carotene in faeces and faecal water, as did lycopene after consumption of tomato juice. In the succeeding depletion phases, carotenoid contents in faeces and faecal water returned to their initial values. Faecal water showed high dose-dependent cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects on colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT29). These effects were not markedly changed by carrot and tomato juice consumption. Neither bile acid concentrations nor activities of the bacterial enzymes beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase in faecal water changed after carrot and tomato juice consumption. Faecal water pH decreased only after carrot juice consumption. SCFA were probably not responsible for this effect, as SCFA concentrations and profiles did not change significantly. In summary, in the present study, 2-week interventions with carotenoid-rich juices led only to minor changes in investigated luminal biomarkers relevant to colon carcinogenesis.

[INST]  Extract all references to food items from the text:   Since evidence relating diet to breast cancer risk is not sufficiently consistent to elaborate preventive proposals, the authors examined the association between dietary patterns and breast cancer risk in a large French cohort study. The analyses included 2,381 postmenopausal invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed during a median 9.7-year follow-up period (1993-2005) among 65,374 women from the E3N-EPIC cohort. Scores for dietary patterns were obtained by factor analysis, and breast cancer hazard ratios were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression for the highest quartile of dietary pattern score versus the lowest. Two dietary patterns were identified: "alcohol/Western" (essentially meat products, French fries, appetizers, rice/pasta, potatoes, pulses, pizza/pies, canned fish, eggs, alcoholic beverages, cakes, mayonnaise, and butter/cream) and "healthy/Mediterranean" (essentially vegetables, fruits, seafood, olive oil, and sunflower oil). The first pattern was positively associated with breast cancer risk (hazard ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.38; P = 0.007 for linear trend), especially when tumors were estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive. The "healthy/Mediterranean" pattern was negatively associated with breast cancer risk (hazard ratio = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.95; P = 0.003 for linear trend), especially when tumors were estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative.

Moreover, cervical cancer and male esophageal cancer have declined significantly, and changes in the trends of cancer of the following sites were of borderline significance: decreasing male laryngeal and female esophageal cancers and increasing prostate and female breast cancers. These changes have occurred along with dietary shifts in the population, from a diet predominantly of rice and small portions of meat, vegetables, and fish to one with larger portions of all foods but rice and eggs. The latter data were gathered from six government household surveys from 1963-64 to 1994-95. By combining the two data sets, correlation coefficients were calculated for per capita consumption patterns of eight foods (rice, pork, beef, poultry, saltwater fish, freshwater fish, fresh vegetables, and eggs) and cancer incidence data of the same year or 10 years later. Higher meat intakes were significantly and positively correlated with cancers of the colon, rectum, prostate, and female breast. The correlations also suggested that current diets were more influential than diets a decade before for cancers of the lung, esophagus, rectum, and prostate. Cancers of the nasopharynx and colon were significantly correlated with current and past diets. These results support the hypothesis that intakes of meat and its associated fat are risk factors for colon, rectal, prostate, and female breast cancers.

[INST]  Retrieve all food entities mentioned in the text:   Recent recommendations by the American Diabetes Association suggest that children with type 1 diabetes should follow the recommendations for age, sex and body size of the general population. In the case of being overweight or obese, weight-control strategies should be applied. Adherence to recommendations should be pursued by continuous nutritional education that should start at the onset of diabetes and maintained by means of nutritional counselling to the family. The second main target of nutritional intervention is to encourage a reproducible daily meal plan that can be maintained by acquiring good habits when making nutritional choices. Finally, children and parents should be taught how to count carbohydrates, which would help them manage exceptions in their daily meal plan. Specifically, nutritional recommendations for children with diabetes focus on limiting the intake of foods of animal origin (red meat, cheese, cold cuts), moderating fat intake and promoting the intake of foods that naturally contain fibre (mainly vegetables, legumes, fruit). There are two at-risk periods in the lives of children when nutritional education procedures as well as diabetes care in general are less likely to be effective: early years of life and adolescence. In the case of very young children, new behavioural-based intervention strategies to help parents improve mealtimes could be useful in teaching diabetic children to learn to follow a structured eating schedule, which is desirable for long-lasting efficacy in diabetes care. In adolescents, eating disorders and insulin misuse for weight control purposes are concrete and difficult problems to deal with. A good balance between eating for pleasure and maintaining one's health is a challenge for anyone. Appropriate nutritional education helps children with diabetes to find this balance and enjoy a better quality of life.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items listed in the text:   The medicinal use of cacao, or chocolate, both as a primary remedy and as a vehicle to deliver other medicines, originated in the New World and diffused to Europe in the mid 1500s. These practices originated among the Olmec, Maya and Mexica (Aztec). The word cacao is derived from Olmec and the subsequent Mayan languages (kakaw); the chocolate-related term cacahuatl is Nahuatl (Aztec language), derived from Olmec/Mayan etymology. Early colonial era documents included instructions for the medicinal use of cacao. The Badianus Codex (1552) noted the use of cacao flowers to treat fatigue, whereas the Florentine Codex (1590) offered a prescription of cacao beans, maize and the herb tlacoxochitl (Calliandra anomala) to alleviate fever and panting of breath and to treat the faint of heart. Subsequent 16th to early 20th century manuscripts produced in Europe and New Spain revealed >100 medicinal uses for cacao/chocolate. Three consistent roles can be identified: 1) to treat emaciated patients to gain weight; 2) to stimulate nervous systems of apathetic, exhausted or feeble patients; and 3) to improve digestion and elimination where cacao/chocolate countered the effects of stagnant or weak stomachs, stimulated kidneys and improved bowel function. Additional medical complaints treated with chocolate/cacao have included anemia, poor appetite, mental fatigue, poor breast milk production, consumption/tuberculosis, fever, gout, kidney stones, reduced longevity and poor sexual appetite/low virility. Chocolate paste was a medium used to administer drugs and to counter the taste of bitter pharmacological additives. In addition to cacao beans, preparations of cacao bark, oil (cacao butter), leaves and flowers have been used to treat burns, bowel dysfunction, cuts and skin irritations.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   The Mushroom Council convened the Mushrooms and Health Summit in Washington, DC, on 9-10 September 2013. The proceedings are synthesized in this article. Although mushrooms have long been regarded as health-promoting foods, research specific to their role in a healthful diet and in health promotion has advanced in the past decade. The earliest mushroom cultivation was documented in China, which remains among the top global mushroom producers, along with the United States, Italy, The Netherlands, and Poland. Although considered a vegetable in dietary advice, mushrooms are fungi, set apart by vitamin B-12 in very low quantity but in the same form found in meat, ergosterol converted with UV light to vitamin D2, and conjugated linoleic acid. Mushrooms are a rare source of ergothioneine as well as selenium, fiber, and several other vitamins and minerals. Some preclinical and clinical studies suggest impacts of mushrooms on cognition, weight management, oral health, and cancer risk. Preliminary evidence suggests that mushrooms may support healthy immune and inflammatory responses through interaction with the gut microbiota, enhancing development of adaptive immunity, and improved immune cell functionality. In addition to imparting direct nutritional and health benefits, analysis of U.S. food intake survey data reveals that mushrooms are associated with higher dietary quality. Also, early sensory research suggests that mushrooms blended with meats and lower sodium dishes are well liked and may help to reduce intakes of red meat and salt without compromising taste. As research progresses on the specific health effects of mushrooms, there is a need for effective communication efforts to leverage mushrooms to improve overall dietary quality.

[INST]  Extract all food entities referenced in the text:   We previously have shown that ingested beef protein is just as potent as glucose in stimulating a rise in insulin concentration in type II diabetic patients. A synergistic effect was seen when given with glucose. Therefore, we considered it important to determine if other common dietary proteins also strongly stimulate an increase in insulin concentration when given with glucose. Seventeen type II (non-insulin-dependent) untreated diabetic subjects were given single breakfast meals consisting of 50 g glucose, or 50 g glucose plus 25 g protein in the form of lean beef, turkey, gelatin, egg white, cottage cheese, fish, or soy. The peripheral plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, alpha amino nitrogen, urea nitrogen, free fatty acids, and triglycerides were measured. Following ingestion of the meals containing protein, the plasma insulin concentration was increased further and remained elevated longer compared with the meal containing glucose alone. The relative area under the insulin response curve was greatest following ingestion of the meal containing cottage cheese (360%) and was least with egg white (190%) compared with that following glucose alone (100%). The glucose response was diminished following ingestion of the meals containing protein with the exception of the egg white meals. The peripheral glucagon concentration was decreased following ingestion of glucose alone and increased following all the meals containing protein. The alpha amino nitrogen concentration varied considerably. It was decreased after glucose alone, was unchanged after egg white ingestion, and was greatest after ingestion of gelatin. The free fatty acid concentration decrease was 4- to 8-fold greater after the ingestion of protein with glucose compared with ingestion of glucose alone.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   A case-control study was conducted in high- and low-risk areas of Italy to evaluate reasons for the striking geographic variation in gastric cancer (GC) mortality within the country. Personal interviews with 1,016 histologically confirmed GC cases and 1,159 population controls of similar age and sex revealed that the patients were more often of lower social class and resident in rural areas and more frequently reported a familial history of gastric (but not other) cancer. After adjusting for these effects, case-control differences were found for several dietary variables, assessed by asking about the usual frequency of consumption of 146 food items and beverages. A significant trend of increasing GC risk was found with increasing consumption of traditional soups, meat, salted/dried fish and a combination of cold cuts and seasoned cheeses. The habit of adding salt and the preference for salty foods were associated with elevated GC risk, while more frequently storing foods in the refrigerator, the availability of a freezer and use of frozen foods lowered risk. Reduced GC risk were associated with increasing intake of raw vegetables, fresh fruit and citrus fruits. Lowered risk was also related to consumption of spices, olive oil and garlic. Neither cigarette smoking nor alcoholic beverage drinking were significantly related to GC risk. The case-control differences tended to be consistent across geographic areas, despite marked regional variations in intake levels of certain foods. The high-risk areas tended to show higher consumption of food associated with elevated risk (traditional soups, cold cuts) and lower consumption of foods associated with reduced risks (raw vegetables, citrus fruits, garlic). Our findings indicate that dietary factors contribute to the regional variation of stomach cancer occurrence in Italy, and offer clues for further etiologic and prevention research.

[INST]  Identify all references to food present in the text:   People with diabetes are at higher risk of fatal thromboembolic accidents in the cerebral and coronary circulations, especially stroke and ischemic heart disease. We have previously described the hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and anticoagulant activity of orally administered camel milk in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In the present study in the same animal model, we extended these observations by comparing camel milk and the more available and widely consumed bovine milk with respect to their antidiabetic and antithrombotic actions. Rats were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal streptozotocin (65 mg/kg), and then camel milk or bovine milk was administered orally for 8 wk. We evaluated the changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance, blood coagulation profile, and platelet function. Diabetic rats developed weight loss, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, inhibition of platelet aggregation responses to arachidonic acid and adenosine diphosphate, a marked decrease (>50%) in plasma fibrinogen levels, and short activated partial thromboplastin time. Treatment with camel milk or bovine milk reversed these abnormalities, resulting in weight gain, decreased blood glucose levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Despite the more remarkable antidiabetic action of camel milk, treatment with bovine milk was more effective in correcting plasma fibrinogen levels and restoring inhibited platelet aggregation responses. Long-term administration of camel milk or bovine milk counteracted streptozotocin-induced metabolic manifestations in rats, maintained platelet function, and abolished coagulopathy-associated fibrinogen consumption. Notably, the antidiabetic effect of camel milk was more pronounced than that of bovine milk, but bovine milk exhibited more potent anticoagulant activity than camel milk. These findings should encourage further clinical trials to assess the efficiency of camel milk and bovine milk or their derived peptides as food supplements or potential nonpharmacological therapies for dysglycemia and the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities within the text:   To compare the metabolic effect of coingestion of saturated and monounsaturated fats with potato, 12 subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) received 300 g mashed potato alone or in combination with 40 g olive oil, 80 g olive oil, 50 g butter, or 100 g butter, respectively. The blood glucose response area to potatoes with 100 g butter (448 +/- 68 mmol.240 min/L) was significantly lower than after the four other meals: 596 +/- 63 (potato alone), 649 +/- 82 (potato + 40 g olive oil), 587 +/- 80 (potato + 50 g butter), and 604 +/- 81 (potato + 80 g olive oil) nmol.240 min/L, P < 0.05, respectively. The insulin response was significantly increased by adding 50 and 100 g butter, whereas addition of 40 and 80 g olive oil had no effect. The fatty acid concentration was higher when 100 g butter was added to the potato meal than when it was not (0.67 +/- 0.05 compared with 0.48 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, P < 0.05). Fatty acid concentrations were similar to those found for the other meals. The triacylglycerol response increased in a dose-dependent manner with the fat content of the meals irrespective of the type of fat.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   This study assessed dietary and micronutrient intakes of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients at key points in the disease trajectory and evaluated the contribution of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) to micronutrient intake. HNC patients (n = 114) completed a three-day dietary record and a tool to assess Nutrition Impact Scores (NIS) at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up. Foods were classified into food categories. Micronutrient, protein, and energy intakes were compared to European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition guidelines for cancer patients. The majority of patients did not meet recommended dietary intakes for vitamins D, E, C, folate, and magnesium at any study time point. Relative to baseline, the proportion of calories from milk, soup, and ONS significantly increased at post-treatment, while grain, meat, potato, baked dessert, and oil and sugar decreased (P < 0.03). At all study time points, patients categorized as high ONS consumers (>15% of total daily calories from ONS) had higher intakes of micronutrients (P < 0.003). They also had a higher NIS (P = 0.006) and experienced greater weight loss (P < 0.04) during the study, despite having similar energy intake to patients consuming <15% kcal from ONS.

[INST]  Extract all food entities referenced in the text:   High blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events worldwide. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that cocoa-rich products reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. According to this, cocoa has a high content in polyphenols, especially flavanols. Flavanols have been described to exert favorable effects on endothelium-derived vasodilation via the stimulation of nitric oxide-synthase, the increased availability of l-arginine, and the decreased degradation of NO. Cocoa may also have a beneficial effect by protecting against oxidative stress alterations and via decreased platelet aggregation, decreased lipid oxidation, and insulin resistance. These effects are associated with a decrease of blood pressure and a favorable trend toward a reduction in cardiovascular events and strokes. Previous meta-analyses have shown that cocoa-rich foods may reduce blood pressure. Long-term trials investigating the effect of cocoa products are needed to determine whether or not blood pressure is reduced on a chronic basis by daily ingestion of cocoa. Furthermore, long-term trials investigating the effect of cocoa on clinical outcomes are also needed to assess whether cocoa has an effect on cardiovascular events. A 3 mmHg systolic blood pressure reduction has been estimated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. This paper summarizes new findings concerning cocoa effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular health, focusing on putative mechanisms of action and "nutraceutical " viewpoints.

In this study the dietary intakes of young pregnant women attending a Maternal and Infant Care Program at Tuskegee Institute were evaluated for selected vitamins and minerals. Women with toxemia were identified, and women without toxemia served as controls. The toxemia group generally consumed lesser amounts of vitamins and minerals than the controls. However, both groups were deficient (less than two-thirds RDA) in calcium, magnesium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and thiamin. Milk, meat, and grains supplied an appreciable proportion of each vitamin except vitamin A, which was found primarily in the two vegetable groups. Meat and grains contained the greatest quantities of minerals, but milk provided a relatively good proportion of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Anemia was not related to the incidence of toxemia. Women exhibiting anemia consumed smaller amounts of vitamins studied than did women without anemia.

[INST]  Extract all mentions of food from the text:   The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of incorporating lemon leaves and rice straw into the compound feed of diets for dairy goats. Ten Murciano-Granadina dairy goats (n = 5 per group) in mid-lactation were used in a crossover design experiment (2 treatments across 2 periods). Goats were fed a mixed ration with barley grain (control, CON) or CON plus lemon leaves [189 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] and rice straw (120 g/kg of DM) in place of barley grain (LRS). Soybean oil (19 g/kg of DM) was added to the LRS diet to make it isoenergetic (17 MJ of gross energy/kg of DM) relative to CON. After 14 d on their respective treatments, goats were allocated to individual metabolism cages for another 7 d. Subsequently, feed intake, total fecal and urine output, and milk yield were recorded daily over the first 5 d. During the last 2 d, ruminal fluid and blood samples were collected, along with individual gas exchange measurements recorded by a mobile open-circuit indirect calorimetry system using a head box. No differences in DM intake were detected, and ME intake in LRS was lower than in CON (1,095 vs. 1,180 kJ/kg of metabolic body weight). No differences were observed in milk production, but milk fat content was greater in LRS (6.4%) than in CON (5.6%). Greater concentrations of monounsaturated (14.94 vs. 11.96 g/100 g of milk fat) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (4.53 vs. 4.03 g/100 g of milk fat) were detected in the milk of goats fed LRS compared with CON.

Periods of non-centralized water supply or well water as the only source compared to life-long central water supply, and preservation of meat by smoking it with spruce compared to no home smoking of meat, were significantly associated with an increased stomach cancer risk. use of a refrigerator at home for 30 and more years compared to 24 years or less showed an inverse relationship, whereas salt intake estimated by questionnaire showed no relationship to stomach cancer risk. Tobacco smoking was negatively associated with risk for current smokers of cigarettes compared to non-smokers but was presumably not causally related. After adjustment for other food constituents, only increased vitamin C consumption showed an inverse relation to risk. For food groups, increased consumption of fruit, citrus fruit, cheese and whole-meal bread were associated with decreased risk. A similar effect was also seen for increased consumption of raw vegetables. Total vegetable consumption was not particularly associated with risk. Increased consumption of processed meat and of beer showed a positive association with risk whereas increased wine and liquor consumption showed a significant negative association.

Among these, chlorogenic acids (CGAs) received considerable attention for their wide distribution and part of human diet with potential biological effects. CGAs (71 compounds), being esters of derivatives of cinnamic acids with quinic acid are widely distributed in plant materials. Coffee is among the highest found in plants, ranging from 4 to 14%. Besides, these are reported in plant foods such as apples, pears, carrot, tomato, sweet potato, Phyllostachys edulis, oilseeds, Prunus domestica L, cherries, and eggplant. The traditional Chinese medicinal plants such as flowers and buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb and the leaves of Eucommia ulmodies contained CGAs as bioactive compound. These play an important role in the formation of roasted coffee flavor and have a marked influence on coffee cup quality. CGAs are considered as main precursors of coffee flavor and pigments. Recent technological advancements in the separation and purification of CGAs such as molecular-imprinted polymer technique; microwave-assisted extraction; pH gradient counter current chromatography has also been described. The consumption of coffee correlated to several health benefits such as reducing the risk of human chronic diseases such as inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease owing to its antioxidant potential.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   Chocolate ice cream is commonly formulated with higher sugar levels than nonchocolate flavors to compensate for the inherent bitterness of cocoa. Bitterness, however, is an integral part of the complex flavor of chocolate. In light of the global obesity epidemic, many consumers and health professionals are concerned about the levels of added sugars in foods. Once a strategy for balancing undesirable bitterness and health concerns regarding added sugars has been developed, the task becomes determining whether that product will be acceptable to the consumer. Thus, the purpose of this research was to manipulate the bitterness of chocolate ice cream to examine how this influences consumer preferences. The main goal of this study was to estimate group rejection thresholds for bitterness in chocolate ice cream, and to see if solid chocolate preferences (dark vs. milk) generalized to ice cream. A food-safe bitter ingredient, sucrose octaacetate, was added to chocolate ice cream to alter bitterness without disturbing other the sensory qualities of the ice cream samples, including texture. Untrained chocolate ice cream consumers participated in a large-scale sensory test by indicating their preferences for blinded pairs of unspiked and spiked samples, where the spiked sample had increasing levels of the added bitterant. As anticipated, the group containing individuals who prefer milk chocolate had a much lower tolerance for bitterness in their chocolate ice cream compared with the group of individuals who prefer dark chocolate; indeed, the dark chocolate group tolerated almost twice as much added bitterant in the ice cream before indicating a significant preference for the unspiked (control) ice cream. This work demonstrates the successful application of the rejection threshold method to a complex dairy food. Estimating rejection thresholds could prove to be an effective tool for determining acceptable formulations or quality limits when considering attributes that become objectionable at high intensities.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items referenced in the text:   The consumption of dairy, including milk, cheese and yogurt, has been associated with better quality of diet and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death globally. The purpose of this review is to examine recent literature on the relationship between dairy consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. Eighteen observational studies were reviewed, the results of which indicate that total dairy intake does not contribute to cardiovascular disease incidence or death. Based on available data, it appears that milk, cheese, and yogurt are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Data pertaining to dairy fat were inconclusive, but point to a potential protective effect of full-fat milk, cheese, and yogurt on risk of cardiovascular disease. Currently, there is a need to study specific well-defined foods, as opposed to calculating nutrients, in order to better understand these relationships. Future research need not replicate the body of literature on total dairy consumption and associated risk of disease, but rather should focus on the effects of individual dairy foods on cardiovascular events in male and female populations.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms referenced in the text:   The concentrations effects of sugars (trehalose and allose) and oils (canola and coconut oil) on the characteristics of rice starch suspension and mechanical properties of rice starch film were studied. The samples were prepared using 3% (w/w) rice starch, with 10% or 30% (w/w) sugar (trehalose or allose) added and 10% or 30% (w/w) oil (canola or coconut). The droplet size of the film suspension increased with increasing oil concentration both in trehalose and allose, which blended with oil. The flow behavior of the film suspensions showed shear-thinning behavior as calculated by the Power Law model. The apparent viscosity tended to increase with the addition of sugar and oil. The breaking stress of the films blended with sugar and oil was less than that of control. On preparation day and after 7 days' storage, the breaking strain tended to increase more with the addition of coconut oil than with that of canola oil. However, breaking stress and breaking strain decreased after 28 days' storage. Adding sugar had correlation with mechanical properties whereas adding oil had correlation with film suspension characteristics, allowed the sugar and oil to interact and inhibited starch chain mobility due to concentration, sugar type, and oil type. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Trehalose, allose, canola oil, and coconut oil could be used as a plasticizer in a starch edible/biodegradable film system. The preparation process of filmogenic solution was depended on the combination of sugar and oil that could change the flow behavior and affected the mechanical properties of the edible film. The sugar and oil might improve the mechanical properties of the film by a hydroxyl group of sugar and lubricating properties of the oil.

A total of 31,641 (86%) participants completed follow-up, and 365 cases were identified. Four factors with eigenvalues of greater than 2 were identified using the principal factor method with 124 foods/beverages, followed by orthogonal rotation. Variables with factor loadings having absolute values of 0.3 or greater were used in interpreting the factors. Odds ratios for diabetes incidence across quintiles of factor scores were computed by use of logistic regression, adjusting for age, energy intake, family history of diabetes, country of birth, and other factor scores. Factor 1, characterized by olive oil, salad vegetables, and legumes and by avoidance of sweet bakery items, margarine, and tea, was associated with country of birth but not with diabetes. Factor 2, characterized by salad and cooked vegetables, was inversely associated with diabetes. Factor 3, characterized by meats and fatty foods, was associated with increased diabetes risk. A range of fruits loaded strongly on factor 4, which showed little association with diabetes. Avoidance of a dietary pattern including meats and fatty foods, as well as adherence to a pattern including salad and cooked vegetables, is recommended.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food-related terms from the text:   Polyunsaturated meat and dairy products were compared with their saturated counterparts to determine their usefulness in a fat-modified diet for hyperlipidemic persons and their spouses. These polyunsaturated animal products were produced by feeding cattle a supplement of oil droplets coated with denatured protein. As a result, the polyunsaturated fatty acid content was 27 to 28 per cent of the meat fat and butterfat; saturated fatty acids (C12:0 to tc16:0) were 18 to 19 per cent. Of the eleven free-living subjects three were normocholesteremic, three had type IIa hyperlipidemia and five had type VI (IIb). In the fourteen-week study, an adjustment period of three weeks was followed by two consecutive experimental periods of four weeks each, then by a three-week follow-up period. During the adjustment period, participants continued to follow their usual eating patterns. During both experimental periods all followed the same prescribed fat modified food pattern using polyunsaturated margarine and oil. Five participants ate polyunsaturated beef and dairy products during the first experimental period and their saturated counterparts in the second; six participants ate saturated products first, then polyunsaturated. During the follow-up period, all participants selected all their own food. Serum cholesterol levels in five participants who had not previously followed a fat-modified diet were reduced by 18 per cent with polyunsaturated animal products and 11 per cent with saturated products. Serum cholesterol in six participants, previously on a fat-modified diet, was not significantly changed with polyunsaturated products. In ten of eleven participants, serum cholesterol levels were an average of 6 per cent lower with polyunsaturated products than with saturated products. It is concluded that polyunsaturated animal products are suitable for use in fat-modified food patterns for reducing hyperlipidemia, with some restrictions in the amount of polyunsaturated animal fat and with the inclusion of polyunsaturated oil and margarine.

Ninety-eight boys and 74 girls aged 7-17 y treated for > or = 18 mo responded to a quantitative food-frequency questionnaire that was self- (ages 13-17 y) or dietitian-(ages 7-12 y) administered. One hundred nine subjects also completed a weighed food record. Psychosocial assessments included the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self Report, and Children's Global Assessment Scale. The weighed record showed better adherence to dietary guidelines than the food-frequency questionnaire, but energy intake was underestimated. Low energy reporters had a healthier diet than the rest with the weighed record. According to the questionnaire, energy intake was underreported in only 9% of subjects and was not associated with a healthier diet, thus, further analyses were based on the questionnaire. Intakes of vitamin C (P = 0.0001), folate (P = 0.0001), riboflavin (P = 0.03), thiamine (P = 0.0001), and magnesium (P = 0.0001) per megajoule increased as quartile of total fat intake (as a % of total energy) decreased, reflecting increased intakes of cereals (P = 0.002), pasta (P = 0.01), fruit (P = 0.0001), pure meat (not minced or meat products; P = 0.047), skim milk (P = 0.0001), and skim cheese (P = 0.005). Energy and sugar (% of total energy) intakes were not significantly different across all fat intakes; energy density decreased with decreasing fat quartile. Overall psychosocial function score and parental educational level were associated with lower fat intake in multivariate analysis, explaining 11% of the variance in fat intake. We conclude that adherence to fat restriction among children treated for familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased micronutrient density, decreased energy density, and psychosocial factors that facilitate adherence.

Numerous sensors that gather this information are either currently available or in development. Nevertheless, there is still a need to adapt these sensors to special requirements of on-farm utilization such as robustness, calibration and maintenance, costs, operating cycle duration, and high sensitivity and specificity. This paper provides an overview of available sensors, ongoing research, and areas of application for analysis of milk constituents. Currently, the recognition of abnormal milk and the control of udder health is achieved mainly by recording electrical conductivity and changes in milk color. Further indicators of inflammation were recently investigated either to satisfy the high specificity necessary for automatic separation of milk or to create reliable alarm lists. Likewise, milk composition, especially fat:protein ratio, milk urea nitrogen content, and concentration of ketone bodies, provides suitable information about energy and protein supply, roughage fraction in the diet, and metabolic imbalances in dairy cows. In this regard, future prospects are to use frequent on-farm measurements of milk constituents for short-term automatic nutritional management. Finally, measuring progesterone concentration in milk helps farmers detect ovulation, pregnancy, and infertility. Monitoring systems for on-farm or on-line analysis of milk composition are mostly based on infrared spectroscopy, optical methods, biosensors, or sensor arrays. Their calibration and maintenance requirements have to be checked thoroughly before they can be regularly implemented on dairy farms.

Emerging evidence suggests that yogurt consumption might also improve the health of obese individuals. Obesity is often accompanied by chronic, low-grade inflammation perpetuated by adipose tissue and the gut. In the gut, obesity-associated dysregulation of microbiota and impaired gut barrier function may increase endotoxin exposure. Intestinal barrier function can be compromised by pathogens, inflammatory cytokines, endocannabinoids, diet, exercise, and gastrointestinal peptides. Yogurt consumption may improve gut health and reduce chronic inflammation by enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses, intestinal barrier function, lipid profiles, and by regulating appetite.

Osteoporotic bone fracture rates are highest in countries that consume the most dairy, calcium, and animal protein. Most studies of fracture risk provide little or no evidence that milk or other dairy products benefit bone. Accumulating evidence shows that consuming milk or dairy products may contribute to the risk of prostate and ovarian cancers, autoimmune diseases, and some childhood ailments. Because milk is not necessary for humans after weaning and the nutrients it contains are readily available in foods without animal protein, saturated fat, and cholesterol, vegetarians may have healthier outcomes for chronic disease if they limit or avoid milk and other dairy products. Bones are better served by attending to calcium balance and focusing efforts on increasing fruit and vegetable intakes, limiting animal protein, exercising regularly, getting adequate sunshine or supplemental vitamin D, and getting approximately 500 mg Ca/d from plant sources. Therefore, dairy products should not be recommended in a healthy vegetarian diet.  [/INST] Absolutely, the entities that pertain to food are:  milk, dairy products, fruit and vegetable, intakes.

The outcomes of such interventions led to widespread acceptance of functional and nutraceutical foods; however, augmenting immunity is a major concern of dietary regimens. Indeed, the immune system is incredible arrangement of specific organs and cells that enabled humans to carry out defense against undesired responses. Its proper functionality is essential to maintain the body homeostasis. Array of plants and their components hold immunomodulating properties. Their possible inclusion in diets could explore new therapeutic avenues to enhanced immunity against diseases. The review intended to highlight the importance of garlic (Allium sativum), green tea (Camellia sinensis), ginger (Zingiber officinale), purple coneflower (Echinacea), black cumin (Nigella sativa), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), Astragalus and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) as natural immune boosters. These plants are bestowed with functional ingredients that may provide protection against various menaces. Modes of their actions include boosting and functioning of immune system, activation and suppression of immune specialized cells, interfering in several pathways that eventually led to improvement in immune responses and defense system.

[INST]  Retrieve all food entities contained in the text:   A dietary case-control study based on 818 newly diagnosed breast cancer (BC) patients was conducted in Israel between 1975 and 1978. The role of coffee and total methylxanthine intake from coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, and cocoa drinks was evaluated in the BC patients as compared to that in two matched control populations [surgical controls (SC) and neighborhood controls (NC)]. Because it has been suggested that caffeine enhances mammary carcinogenesis in rats fed high polyunsaturated fat diets, analysis was done also in relation to fat consumption. When comparison was done to both matched control groups, a nonsignificant negative association was found between consumption of cups of coffee and BC (odds ratios of greater than or equal to 4 cups of coffee/day vs. less than or equal to 1 per week = 0.6 for BC/NC and 0.7 for BC/SC). This association was observed in all 3 ethnic subgroups studied. The pattern was stronger among the high-fat consumers after controlling for several hormonal confounding factors (two-tailed P-value for linear trend = 0.06 for SC and P = 0.05 for NC). In addition, when the consumption of methylxanthine of BC patients was compared to that of benign breast patients, adjusted by age and ethnic group, a diminished risk was found (odds ratio for BC of the highest level of methylxanthine vs. lowest level = 0.59).

Participants were requested to select the specific diet that they wished to follow during the 12 h prior to collection of urine. The only restriction was that the diet could not include any product with cocoa, coffee, or caffeine. On the first day, each volunteer followed their selected diet, and an overnight 12 h urine sample was collected as the baseline urine. After seven days on an unrestricted diet, each volunteer repeated the same diet with 20 g of milk chocolate, chocolate powder, or dark chocolate during breakfast and another 20 g during dinner. Overnight 12 h urine samples were then collected. Urine volume, pH, oxalate, creatinine, uric acid, theobromine, and a uric acid crystallization test were determined for each sample. The results for all 20 patients show that uric acid crystallization was significantly lower following the consumption of chocolate powder or dark chocolate relative to baseline or following the consumption of milk chocolate. The results indicated that increased concentrations of urinary theobromine reduced the risk of uric acid crystallization.

With the high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism are common in the general population and obtaining glycemic control is important in reducing the complications of diabetes. If shown to be effective, botanical products have a unique position in potentially aiding the general public in regard to obesity and diabetes. They can be obtained "over-the-counter" and may have less side effects compared to many synthetic drugs. Although most of the popular botanicals have a long history in folk medicine, there is paucity of data regarding their efficacy and safety, particularly as it relates to human studies. In this review, we discuss the data that was available in the literature for nine botanicals that are frequently promoted to help manage blood glucose. They are Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia), Fenugreek (trigonella foenum graecum), Gymnema Sylvestre, Ivy Gourd (Coccinia indica), Nopal or Prickly Pear Cactus (Opuntia streptacantha), Ginseng, Aloe Vera, Russian Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), and Garlic (Allium sativum). The discussion is emphasized on the clinical aspect of these botanicals.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items mentioned in the text:   The Golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been shown to be a useful model of both human lipoprotein metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis. We report the effects of dietary lipids on the progression and regression of atherosclerosis in this model. In the first study, hamsters fed on coconut oil (150 g/kg diet) and cholesterol (30 g/kg diet) developed lipid-rich lesions in the ascending aorta (0.28 (SD 0.14) mm2) and aortic arch (0.01 (SD 0.01) mm2) after 4 weeks that continued to progress over the next 8 weeks (0.75 (SD 0.41) mm2 and 0.12 (SD 0.11) mm2 for the ascending aorta and aortic arch respectively). Removal of cholesterol from the diet halted this progression. Furthermore, in animals fed on olive oil in the absence of added cholesterol, plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) and the extent of atherosclerotic lesions was reduced (P < 0.001 for both regions of the aorta) compared with animals fed on coconut oil (with no added cholesterol). In a second study, animals were fed on the atherogenic diet for 10 weeks, transferred to diets containing either coconut oil (150 g/kg diet) or olive oil (150 g/kg diet) without added cholesterol and monitored for up to 16 weeks. In the ascending aorta, lesion size doubled in animals fed on coconut oil but stabilized in those fed on olive oil. In the aortic arch, lesion size decreased linearly (P < 0.05, P < 0.001 for coconut oil and olive oil respectively) with the greatest reduction being seen in the olive-oil-fed animals (P < 0.05). Again, progression and regression of atherosclerosis appeared to reflect the relative concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol in the plasma. We conclude that the male Golden Syrian hamster represents a useful model of dietary induced regression as well as progression of atherosclerosis.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food present in the text:   Self-monitoring of plasma triglycerides (TG) may be a very useful tool to monitor, on a daily basis, the TG responses to different nutrients, particularly carbohydrates (CHO) and fat, whose influence on postprandial TG levels is not very well known. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the TG response of hypertriglyceridemic patients to a similar amount of calories deriving from different sources of CHO and fat. Thirty-nine hypertriglyceridemic patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups. In 1 group (the fat group), patients were given a standard meal plus a fat supplement of 300 kcal derived from different types of fat (butter, sunflower margarine, olive oil) for dinner, once a week for 3 weeks. In the other group (the CHO group), patients consumed the same standard meal plus a supplement of 300 kcal derived from different types of CHO (bread, coke, fruit). In both groups, patients measured their plasma TG before and 3 hours after each meal by Accutrend GCT (ROCHE, Mannheim, Germany). A subgroup of patients (n = 18) also performed TG determinations 2 hours after the test meals. The 3-hour TG increments were not significantly different between the different test meals (f = 0.671; P =.52); instead, the TG increments induced by fat supplements were significantly higher than those induced by the CHO supplements (f = 14.31; P =.0001). Similar results were also obtained 2 hours after the test meals. In conclusion, this study shows that the 2- and 3-hour TG responses to fat are higher compared with that induced by carbohydrate. This point, especially if confirmed by experiments with more frequent after meal measurements and of longer duration, should be taken into account in defining the best dietary approach to lower plasma TG levels throughout the whole day.

The evidence for a protective effect of greater vegetable and fruit consumption is consistent for cancers of the stomach, esophagus, lung, oral cavity and pharynx, endometrium, pancreas, and colon. The types of vegetables or fruit that most often appear to be protective against cancer are raw vegetables, followed by allium vegetables, carrots, green vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and tomatoes. Substances present in vegetables and fruit that may help protect against cancer, and their mechanisms, are also briefly reviewed; these include dithiolthiones, isothiocyanates, indole-3-carbinol, allium compounds, isoflavones, protease inhibitors, saponins, phytosterols, inositol hexaphosphate, vitamin C, D-limonene, lutein, folic acid, beta carotene, lycopene, selenium, vitamin E, flavonoids, and dietary fiber. Current US vegetable and fruit intake, which averages about 3.4 servings per day, is discussed, as are possible noncancer-related effects of increased vegetable and fruit consumption, including benefits against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, obesity, diverticulosis, and cataracts.

[INST]  Extract all food-related terms listed in the text:   Public awareness and misunderstandings of lactose intolerance are at an all-time high. Many people erroneously believe they are lactose intolerant or develop gastrointestinal symptoms after intake of lactose. Consequently, lactose-containing foods such as milk and other dairy foods may be eliminated unnecessarily from the diet. Because these foods are a major source of calcium, low intake of them can compromise calcium nutriture. This, in turn, can increase the risk of major chronic diseases such as osteoporosis (porous bones) and hypertension. This review is intended to help dietetics professionals alleviate clients' fears about lactose intolerance and recommend dietary strategies to improve tolerance to lactose. Scientific findings indicate that the prevalence of lactose intolerance is grossly overestimated. Other physiologic and psychologic factors can contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms that mimic lactose intolerance. Scientific findings also indicate that people with laboratory-confirmed low levels of the enzyme lactase can consume 1 serving of milk with a meal or 2 servings of milk per day in divided doses at breakfast and dinner without experiencing symptoms. Several dietary strategies are available to help lactose maldigesters include milk and other dairy foods in their diet without experiencing symptoms.

[INST]  Extract all food entities present in the text:   In a previous European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (EPIC) analysis, we found an inverse association between total intake of vegetables, onion and garlic, and risk of intestinal gastric cancer (GC) and between citrus fruit and risk of cardia GC. The aim of this study is to reanalyze the effect of fruit and vegetables (F&V), based on a longer follow-up and twice the number of GC cases. Subjects are 477,312 men and women mostly aged 35 to 70 years participating in the EPIC cohort, including 683 gastric adenocarcinomas with 11 years of follow-up. Information on diet and lifestyle was collected at baseline. A calibration study in a subsample was used to correct for dietary measurement errors. When comparing the highest vs. lowest quintile of intake, we found an inverse association between total intake of V&F and GC risk [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-1.04; p for trend 0.02], between fresh fruit and risk of the diffuse type (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.36-0.97; p for trend 0.03) and an inverse association between citrus fruit and risk of cardia cancer (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.38-1.00, p for trend 0.01). Although calibration revealed somewhat stronger inverse associations, none of the risks reached statistical significance. There was no association between total or specific vegetables intake and GC risk. The inverse association between fresh fruit and citrus fruits and risk of GC seems to be restricted to smokers and the Northern European countries. Fresh fruit and citrus fruit consumption may protect against diffuse and cardia GC, respectively.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   Gluten proteins in wheat, rye and barley cause celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, which affects approximately 1% of the world population. Gluten is comprised of prolamin and glutelin. Since avoidance of dietary gluten is the only option for celiac patients, a sensitive gluten detection and quantitation method is warranted. Most regulatory agencies have set a threshold of 20 ppm gluten in foods labeled gluten-free, based on the currently available ELISA methods. However, these methods may exhibit differences in gluten quantitation from different gluten-containing grains. In this study, prolamin and glutelin fractions were isolated from wheat, rye, barley, oats and corn. Intact and pepsin-trypsin (PT)-digested prolamin and glutelin fractions were used to assess their immunoreactivity and gluten recovery by three sandwich and two competitive ELISA kits. The Western blots revealed varied affinity of ELISA antibodies to gluten-containing grain proteins and no reactivity to oat and corn proteins. ELISA results showed considerable variation in gluten recoveries from both intact and PT-digested gluten fractions among different kits. Prolamin fractions showed higher gluten recovery compared to their respective glutelin fractions. Among prolamins, barley exhibited higher recovery compared to wheat and rye with most of the ELISA kits used. Hydrolysis resulted in reduced gluten recovery of most gluten fractions. These results suggest that the suitability of ELISA for accurate gluten quantitation is dependent upon various factors, such as grain source, antibody specificity, gluten proteins and the level of their hydrolysis in foods.

Controlled field experiments with potatoes, beans and lettuce (Solanum tuberosum L., Phaseolus vulgaris L. and Lactuca sativa L.) were carried out in a contaminated soil used by local farmers located near a closed Portuguese uranium mine (Cunha Baixa, Mangualde). The soil with high average uranium levels (64-252 mg/kg) was divided in two plots, and irrigated with non-contaminated and uranium-contaminated water (<20 and >900 microg/L). Uranium maximum average concentration in the edible vegetables parts (mg/kg fresh weight) ranged in the following order: lettuce (234 microg/kg) > green bean (30 microg/kg) > potatoes without peel (4 microg/kg). Although uranium in soil, irrigation water and vegetables was high, the assessment of the health risk based on hazard quotient indicates that consumption of these vegetables does not represent potential adverse (no carcinogenic) effects for a local inhabitant during lifetime.

[INST]  Extract all mentions of food from the text:   Observational studies provide evidence that a higher intake of protein from plant-based foods and certain animal-based foods is associated with a lower risk for type 2 diabetes. However, there are few distinguishable differences between the glucoregulatory qualities of the proteins in plant-based foods, and it is likely their numerous non-protein components (e.g., fibers and phytochemicals) that drive the relationship with type 2 diabetes risk reduction. Conversely, the glucoregulatory qualities of the proteins in animal-based foods are extremely divergent, with a higher intake of certain animal-based protein foods showing negative effects, and others showing neutral or positive effects on type 2 diabetes risk. Among the various types of animal-based protein foods, a higher intake of dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, cheese and whey protein) consistently shows a beneficial relationship with glucose regulation and/or type 2 diabetes risk reduction. Intervention studies provide evidence that dairy proteins have more potent effects on insulin and incretin secretion compared to other commonly consumed animal proteins. In addition to their protein components, such as insulinogenic amino acids and bioactive peptides, dairy products also contain a food matrix rich in calcium, magnesium, potassium, trans-palmitoleic fatty acids, and low-glycemic index sugars-all of which have been shown to have beneficial effects on aspects of glucose control, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and/or type 2 diabetes risk. Furthermore, fermentation and fortification of dairy products with probiotics and vitamin D may improve a dairy product's glucoregulatory effects.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Epidemiologic studies from numerous disparate populations reveal that individuals with the habit of daily moderate wine consumption enjoy significant reductions in all-cause and particularly cardiovascular mortality when compared with individuals who abstain or who drink alcohol to excess. Researchers are working to explain this observation in molecular and nutritional terms. Moderate ethanol intake from any type of beverage improves lipoprotein metabolism and lowers cardiovascular mortality risk. The question now is whether wine, particularly red wine with its abundant content of phenolic acids and polyphenols, confers additional health benefits. Discovering the nutritional properties of wine is a challenging task, which requires that the biological actions and bioavailability of the >200 individual phenolic compounds be documented and interpreted within the societal factors that stratify wine consumption and the myriad effects of alcohol alone. Further challenge arises because the health benefits of wine address the prevention of slowly developing diseases for which validated biomarkers are rare. Thus, although the benefits of the polyphenols from fruits and vegetables are increasingly accepted, consensus on wine is developing more slowly. Scientific research has demonstrated that the molecules present in grapes and in wine alter cellular metabolism and signaling, which is consistent mechanistically with reducing arterial disease. Future research must address specific mechanisms both of alcohol and of polyphenolic action and develop biomarkers of their role in disease prevention in individuals.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   Probiotic foods, including fermented dairy (FD) products such as yogurt and cheese, naturally contain live microorganisms, but the relationship between the consumption of probiotic foods and health is unclear. The aim of the present narrative review is to integrate the available information on the relationship between the most studied FD products, which are yogurt and cheese, and cardiometabolic risk factors obtained from meta-analysis, systematic reviews of prospective cohort studies (PCSs) and PCSs published up to 2 November 2019. Additionally, the effects identified by randomized controlled trials of less-studied FD products, such as kefir and kimchi, on cardiometabolic risk factors are provided. PCSs have shown that the consumption of cheese, despite its high saturated fat content, is not associated with expected hypercholesterolemia and an increased cardiovascular risk. PCSs have revealed that the total consumption of FD appears to be associated with a lower risk of developing stroke and cardiovascular disease. The consumption of yogurt seems to be associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. There is a lack of sufficient evidence of a protective relationship between FD or cheese consumption and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the association of FD, cheese and yogurt with hypertension needs further evidence. In conclusion, the intake of fermented foods containing probiotics, particularly yogurt and cheese (of an undetermined type), opens up new opportunities for the management of cardiometabolic risk factors.

[INST]  Locate all food items present in the text:   Plant lectins, a unique group of proteins and glycoproteins with potent biological activity, occur in foods like wheat, corn, tomato, peanut, kidney bean, banana, pea, lentil, soybean, mushroom, rice, and potato. Thus, dietary intakes by humans can be significant. Many lectins resist digestion, survive gut passage, and bind to gastrointestinal cells and/or enter the circulation intact, maintaining full biological activity. Several lectins have been found to possess anticancer properties in vitro, in vivo, and in human case studies; they are used as therapeutic agents, preferentially binding to cancer cell membranes or their receptors, causing cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor growth. These compounds can become internalized into cells, causing cancer cell agglutination and/or aggregation. Ingestion of lectins also sequesters the available body pool of polyamines, thereby thwarting cancer cell growth. They also affect the immune system by altering the production of various interleukins, or by activating certain protein kinases. Lectins can bind to ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. They also modify the cell cycle by inducing non-apoptotic G1-phase accumulation mechanisms, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and can activate the caspase cascade. Lectins can also downregulate telomerase activity and inhibit angiogenesis. Although lectins seem to have great potential as anticancer agents, further research is still needed and should include a genomic and proteomic approach.

This cross-sectional study determined the frequency of consumption of traditional meats (e.g. caribou, polar bear, seal, char and whale) and non-traditional store-bought foods including non-traditional meats (e.g. beef, pork and chicken), grains, dairy, fruits, vegetables and non-nutrient dense foods (NNDFs) (e.g. butter, chocolate, chips, candy and pop) by Inuvialuit adults (175 women, mean age 44 <U+00B1> 14 years; 55 men, mean age 41 <U+00B1> 13 years) in three remote communities in the Northwest Territories. Using a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire, frequency of consumption over a 30-day period was determined for 141 commonly reported foods. Mean consumption of traditional meats (1.6 times/day), fruits (1 time/day) and vegetables (0.6 times/day) was less frequent than that of NNDFs (5.0 times/day). Nutritional intervention strategies are needed to promote more frequent consumption of nutrient-rich foods and less frequent consumption of NNDFs in these Arctic communities.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food-related terms in the text:   Today, tens of millions of elderly individuals worldwide suffer from dementia. While the pathogenesis of dementia is complex and incompletely understood, it may be, at least to a certain extent, the consequence of systemic vascular pathology. The metabolic syndrome and its individual components induce a proinflammatory state that damages blood vessels. This condition of chronic inflammation may damage the vasculature of the brain or be directly neurotoxic. Associations have been established between the metabolic syndrome, its constituents and dementia. A relationship has also been observed between certain dietary factors, such as constituents of the 'Mediterranean diet', and the metabolic syndrome; similar associations have been noted between these dietary factors and dementia. Fruit juices and extracts are under investigation as treatments for cognitive impairment. Blueberry, strawberry, blackberry, grape and plum juices or extracts have been successfully tested in cognitively impaired rodents. Published trials of the benefits of grape and blueberry juice in the treatment of small numbers of cognitively impaired persons have recently appeared. The benefits of fruit products are thought to be a result of its polyphenol content. A grape polyphenol found in grapes, resveratrol, now being studied in humans, and one in grapes and blueberries, pterostilbene, have been found to improve cognition in rodents. In the design of future human trials, one ought to consider the poor bioavailability of these products, the possible need to initiate the experimental therapy long before the onset of symptoms, and currently limited knowledge about the appropriate form (e.g. juice, powder or individual polyphenol) of treatment.

Females reported FS more often than males. A correlation was found between birch pollen allergy and FS with nuts, apple, peach, cherry, pear, plum, carrot and new potato. The higher the degree of birch pollen allergy, according to skin test, RAST or provocation test, the higher the frequency of FS. A correlation was found too between acetylsalicylic acid intolerance and FS with some foods, e.g. nuts, strawberry, almond, green pepper, hip, chocolate, egg, cabbage, milk and wine. The connection between birch pollen allergy and FS is probably explained by the structural relationship between birch pollen allergen and some allergens of the foodstuffs, whereas the high incidence of FS in acetylsalicylic acid-intolerant patients is probably explained by additives in foods as well as salicylates or benzoates naturally occurring in some food.

Participants ranged in age from 25 to 64 years and resided in three socioeconomically distinct neighborhoods of San Antonio, TX: low income, middle income, and upper income. A scale was constructed to assess the degree to which individuals avoided six dietary sources of saturated fat and cholesterol. Women of both ethnic groups were found to avoid saturated fat and cholesterol to a greater degree than men, scoring higher on five of the six components of the scale. Saturated fat/cholesterol avoidance increased significantly with increased socioeconomic status in both ethnic groups. Although there were no ethnic differences in overall saturated fat/cholesterol avoidance, more non-Hispanic whites recognized milk, eggs, and visible fat on meat as food sources to avoid. The scale described in this paper provides useful information about the specific food components recognized as dietary sources of saturated fat and cholesterol and helps identify those population groups that would benefit from nutrition education programs. Because of its simplicity and ease of administration, the scale may be a useful tool in epidemiological research.

Evaluation of the possible anticarcinogenic properties of their ingredients is confounded by the potential increase in risk owing to the high temperatures at which these beverages are generally consumed. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the association between coffee and tea consumption and the risk of UADT cancer. The study enrolled 961 patients with UADT cancer and 2,883 noncancer outpatients who visited Aichi Cancer Center between 2001 and 2005. Information on coffee and green tea consumption and other lifestyle factors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Consumption of three or more cups of coffee per day had a significant inverse association with UADT cancer [odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.96]. In contrast, consumption of three or more cups of green tea per day had a significant positive association with UADT cancer (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.13-1.70). These associations were evident for head and neck cancer but not for esophageal cancer. The association of coffee consumption with head and neck cancer was observed only among never smokers and alcohol drinkers. Similarly, the association of green tea consumption was observed among never smokers and never alcohol drinkers. No change in these associations was seen on stratification by each confounding factors. These findings suggest that consumption of coffee might be associated with a decreased risk of UADT cancer, whereas that of green tea might be associated with an increased risk.

To fill the knowledge gap, dietary intake was assessed in 2057 children using a 24-hour dietary recall. All reported foods and beverages were assigned to one of 76 food groups. Percent contribution of each food group to nutrient intake was estimated for four age groups: 0-5.9, 6-11.9, 12-23.9, and 24-47.9 months. Breast milk, infant formula, and cow's milk were the top sources of energy and nutrients, especially in younger groups. Among infants aged 6-11.9 months, the top food sources of energy included soups and stews, cookies, fruit, tortillas, eggs and egg dishes, and traditional beverages. The same foods plus sweetened breads, dried beans, and sandwiches and tortas were consumed as the top sources of energy among toddlers and young children. Milk, soups, and stews were the top contributors for all nutrients and tortillas, eggs, and egg dishes were among the top contributors for iron and zinc. This study showed that low nutrient-dense cookies, sweetened breads, and traditional beverages were among the core foods consumed early in life in Mexico. This compromises the intake of more nutritious foods such as vegetables and fortified cereals and increases the risk of obesity.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food-related terms from the text:   Neutrophil function and the severity and incidence of mastitis in dairy cows is related to the intake of many antioxidant nutrients. Because vitamin C is the major water-soluble antioxidant in mammals, we examined the effect of dietary vitamin C on neutrophil function and responses to intramammary infusion of lipopolysaccahride (LPS) in periparturient dairy cows. At 2 wk before anticipated calving, Holstein cows were fed diets that provided 0 (16 cows) or 30 (15 cows) g/d of supplemental vitamin C (phosphorylated ascorbic acid). Treatments continued until 7 d after cows received an infusion of 10 microg of LPS into one quarter of the mammary gland (on average, this occurred 32 d postcalving). Supplementation of vitamin C increased plasma concentrations of vitamin C at calving, but no differences were observed in samples taken 24 h postinfusion. Concentrations of vitamin C in milk (24 h postinfusion) and in neutrophils (calving and 24 h postinfusion) were not affected by treatment, but vitamin C concentrations in neutrophils isolated from milk were about 3 times greater than concentrations in blood neutrophils. The LPS infusion did not alter concentrations of vitamin C in plasma or milk, suggesting that the LPS model did not produce the same effects as a bacterial infection of the mammary gland with respect to antioxidant effects. Supplemental vitamin C had no effect on neutrophil phagocytosis or bacterial kill. Dietary vitamin C reduced the milk somatic cell count but did not affect the febrile response or milk production following LPS infusion.

[INST]  Find all mentions of food entities in the text:   Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the villi of the small intestine causing abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, or bad absorption due to gluten intolerance. The only treatment for this disease consists of a lifelong gluten free diet; this is, celiac people cannot consume products containing gluten, such as wheat, barley, and rye, but they can use rice and corn. Thus, rice flour is mainly used for the manufacturing of the basic products of this population. Unfortunately, rice can contain high contents of total (t-As) and inorganic (i-As) arsenic. The current study demonstrated that products for celiac children with a high percentage of rice contained high concentrations of arsenic (256 and 128 <U+03BC>g kg<U+207B><U+00B9>). The daily intake of i-As ranged from 0.61 to 0.78 <U+03BC>g kg<U+207B><U+00B9> body weight (bw) in children up to 5 y of age; these values were below the maximum value established by the EFSA Panel (8.0 <U+03BC>g kg<U+207B><U+00B9> bw per day), but it should be considered typical of populations with a high exposure to this pollutant. Finally, legislation is needed to improve the labeling of these special rice-based foods for celiac children; label should include information about percentage, geographical origin, and cultivar of the used rice.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms present in the text:   Consumption of olive oil within the Mediterranean diet has been long known to have many health benefits. However, only over the last decade has epidemiological research confirmed its protective role against developing several chronic diseases. The objective of this review was to give an overview of the state of art epidemiological evidence concerning the relationship between olive oil and key public health outcomes including mortality, CVD, diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MetS), obesity and cancer, with a particular focus on recent results from cohort studies and dietary intervention trials. Recent epidemiological research has shown that regular consumption of olive oil is associated with increased longevity. This benefit is partly due to the olive oil's unequivocal cardio-protective role. There is converging evidence on the benefits of olive oil for preventing several CVD risk factors, including diabetes, MetS and obesity. Olive oil is also implicated in preventing certain cancers, with the most promising findings for breast and digestive tract cancers, although the data are still not entirely consistent and mainly from case-control studies. These health benefits are supported by strong mechanistic evidence from experimental studies, demonstrating that specific components of olive oil have antihypertensive, antithrombotic, antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic action. Despite the accumulating epidemiological research, there is still a lack of consistent results from high-quality studies for many health outcomes (i.e. certain cancers and metabolism-related disorders). Further research is mandatory, above all from prospective studies and randomised dietary intervention trials when feasible, to confirm some of the still potential health benefits.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food present in the text:   Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in Australia. Nutrition, particularly intake of vegetables and certain plant components, has been reported to have a major role in cancer risk reduction. Recently, there has been a growing research interest in rosemary, a common household plant grown in many parts of the world. This study aims to review scientific evidence from all studies, published from 1996 to March 2010 that examined the protective effects of rosemary on colorectal cancer and other types of cancer. Literature evidence from animal and cell culture studies demonstrates the anticancer potential of rosemary extract, carnosol, carnosic acid, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. No evidence for other rosemary constituents was found. The reported anticancer properties were found to arise through the molecular changes in the multiple-stage process of cancer development, which are dose related and not tissue or species specific. This is evidenced by the ability of rosemary to suppress the development of tumors in several organs including the colon, breast, liver, stomach, as well as melanoma and leukemia cells. The results suggested that the different molecular targets modulated by rosemary and its active constituents are useful indicators of success in clinical cancer chemo-prevention trials.

In 2011, the first iteration of our allergen threshold database (ATDB) was established based on individual NOAELs and LOAELs from oral food challenge in roughly 1750 allergic individuals. Population minimal eliciting dose (EDp) distributions based on this dataset were published for 11 allergenic foods in 2014. Systematic data collection has continued (2011-2018) and the dataset now contains over 3400 data points. The current study provides new and updated EDp values for 14 allergenic foods and incorporates a newly developed Stacked Model Averaging statistical method for interval-censored data. ED01 and ED05 values, the doses at which 1%, and respectively 5%, of the respective allergic population would be predicted to experience any objective allergic reaction were determined. The 14 allergenic foods were cashew, celery, egg, fish, hazelnut, lupine, milk, mustard, peanut, sesame, shrimp (for crustacean shellfish), soy, walnut, and wheat. Updated ED01 estimates ranged between 0.03<U+00A0>mg for walnut protein and 26.2<U+00A0>mg for shrimp protein. ED05 estimates ranged between 0.4<U+00A0>mg for mustard protein and 280<U+00A0>mg for shrimp protein.

[INST]  Extract all food entities listed in the text:   The association between intake of different dairy products and the risk of stroke remains unclear. We therefore investigated substitutions between dairy product subgroups and risk of stroke. We included 36 886 Dutch men and women. Information about dairy product intake was collected through a FFQ. Dairy products were grouped as low-fat milk, whole-fat milk, buttermilk, low-fat yogurt, whole-fat yogurt, cheese and butter. Incident stroke cases were identified in national registers. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate associations for substitutions between dairy products with the rate of stroke. During a median follow-up of 15<U+00B7>2 years we identified 884 stroke cases (503 ischaemic and 244 haemorrhagic). Median intake of total dairy products was four servings/d. Low-fat yogurt substituted for whole-fat yogurt was associated with a higher rate of ischaemic stroke (hazard ratio (HR) = 2<U+00B7>58 (95 % CI 1<U+00B7>11, 5<U+00B7>97)/serving per d). Whole-fat yogurt as a substitution for any other subgroup was associated with a lower rate of ischaemic stroke (HR between 0<U+00B7>33 and 0<U+00B7>36/serving per d). We did not observe any associations for haemorrhagic stroke.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   The incidence and severity of hypertension are affected by nutritional status and intake of many nutrients. Excessive energy intake and obesity are major causes of hypertension. Obesity is associated with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, possibly other mineralcorticoid activity, insulin resistance, salt-sensitive hypertension and excess salt intake, and reduced kidney function. High sodium chloride intake strongly predisposes to hypertension. Increased alcohol consumption may acutely elevate blood pressure. High intakes of potassium, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and protein, along with exercise and possibly vitamin D, may reduce blood pressure. Less-conclusive studies suggest that amino acids, tea, green coffee bean extract, dark chocolate, and foods high in nitrates may reduce blood pressure. Short-term studies indicate that specialized diets may prevent or ameliorate mild hypertension; most notable are the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and the DASH low-sodium diet.

Low bone mass is related to increased incidence of osteoporotic fractures. Data from the USDA 1987-88 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey were used to determine populations most at risk of less than optimal calcium intake and food sources of calcium intake. Mean per capita daily consumption of calcium for the total U.S. population was 737 mg and varied by region of the country, household income, ethnic group, sex, and age. For most groups of females, intake was substantially less than the RDA. About 50% of total dietary calcium was supplied by milk and milk products.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   Chocolate elicits unique brain activity compared to other foods, activating similar brain regions and neurobiological substrates with potentially similar psychoactive effects as substances of abuse. We sought to determine the relationship between chocolate with varying combinations of its main constituents (sugar, cocoa, and fat) and its psychoactive effects. Participants consumed 5 g of a commercially available chocolate with increasing amounts of sugar (90% cocoa, 85% cocoa, 70% cocoa, and milk chocolates). After each chocolate sample, participants completed the Psychoactive Effects Questionnaire (PEQ). The PEQ consists of questions taken from the Morphine-Benzedrine Group (MBG), Morphine (M,) and Excitement (E) subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory. After all testing procedures, participants completed the Binge Eating Scale (BES) while left alone and allowed to eat as much as they wanted of each of the different chocolates. We found a measurable psychoactive dose<U+207B>effect relationship with each incremental increase in the chocolate's sugar content. The total number of positive responses and the number of positive responses on the E subscale began increasing after tasting the 90% cocoa chocolate, whereas the number of positive responses on the MBG and M subscales began increasing after tasting the 85% cocoa chocolate sample. We did not find a correlation between BES scores and the total amount of chocolate consumed or self-reported scores on the PEQ. These results suggest that each incremental increase in chocolate's sugar content enhances its psychoactive effects. These results extend our understanding of chocolate's appeal and unique ability to prompt an addictive-like eating response.

Cocoa consumption is correlated with reduced health risks of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer, and the health-promoting effects of cocoa are mediated by cocoa-driven phytochemicals. Cocoa is rich in procyanidins, theobromine, (-)-epicatechin, catechins, and caffeine. Among the phytochemicals present in consumed cocoa, theobromine is most available in human plasma, followed by caffeine, (-)-epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins. It has been reported that cocoa phytochemicals specifically modulate or interact with specific molecular targets linked to the pathogenesis of chronic human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, diabetes, and skin aging.

Improving knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to salt intake in the general population is a key component of salt reduction strategies. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the KAP of adults related to salt in urban areas of five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The survey included 588 participants aged 25 to 65 years who were selected using convenience samples in the urban areas of Benin, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, and Seychelles. Socio-demographic and food consumption were assessed using a structured closed-ended questionnaire administered by survey officers. Height, weight, and blood pressure were measured. Food consumption varied largely between countries. Processed foods high in salt, such as processed meat, cheese, pizzas, and savory snacks were consumed rather infrequently in all the countries, but salt-rich foods, such as soups or bread and salty condiments, were consumed frequently in all countries. The majority of the participants knew that high salt intake can cause health problems (85%) and thought that it is important to limit salt intake (91%). However, slightly over half (56%) of the respondents regularly tried to limit their salt intake while only 8% of the respondents thought that they consumed too much salt. Salt and salty condiments were added most of the time during cooking (92% and 64%, respectively) but rarely at the table (11%). These findings support the need for education campaigns to reduce salt added during cooking and for strategies to reduce salt content in selected manufactured foods in the region.

The cancer patient group included persons diagnosed with cancers of the oral cavity, stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, uterus, cervix, prostate, or bladder. Data were obtained by means of a standardized admissions questionnaire. As a group, control patients were more likely to report never drinking whole milk; cancer patients more often reported frequent consumption of whole milk. Relative risks of different patterns of milk consumption for specific cancer diagnoses, adjusted for sex, age, smoking history, education, and county of residence, were calculated with multiple logistic regression analysis. Elevated risks for frequent consumption of whole milk relative to not drinking milk were observed for cancers of the oral cavity, stomach, colon, rectum, lung, bladder, breast, and cervix. Reduced risks for frequent consumption of 2% milk relative to not drinking milk were observed for cancers of the oral cavity, stomach, rectum, lung, and cervix. Preference for exclusive consumption of reduced-fat milk was linked to significant risk reduction for oral and cervical cancers, and drinking only whole milk was linked to significant risk increases for cancers of the oral cavity, stomach, rectum, lung, and breast. Some associations were observed for a computed index of milk fat intake, but the overall pattern of effects was not fully explained by variations in fat content.

Flavonoids represent a large class of phenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, cocoa, tea, and other beverages. Flavonoids have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Given the putative relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance, the consumption of flavonoids or flavonoid-rich foods has been suggested to reduce the risk of diabetes by targeting inflammatory signals. This is the first comprehensive review summarizing the current research progress on the inhibition of inflammation and alleviation of insulin resistance by flavonoids as well as the mechanistic link between these disorders.

However, the scientific and technological revolution in Western countries made fermentation turn from a household to a controlled process suitable for industrial scale production systems intended for the mass marketplace. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the latest studies which investigated the health-promoting components forming upon fermentation of the main food matrices, in order to contribute to understanding their important role in healthy diets and relevance in national dietary recommendations worldwide. Formation of antioxidant, bioactive, anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, and FODMAP-reducing components in fermented foods are mainly presented and discussed. Fermentation was found to increase antioxidant activity of milks, cereals, fruit and vegetables, meat and fish. Anti-hypertensive peptides are detected in fermented milk and cereals. Changes in vitamin content are mainly observed in fermented milk and fruits. Fermented milk and fruit juice were found to have probiotic activity.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food present in the text:   Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a collective term for positional and geometric isomers of octadecadienoic acid in which the double bonds are conjugated, i.e. contiguous. CLA was identified as a component of milk and dairy products over 20 years ago. It is formed as an intermediate in the course of the conversion of linoleic acid to oleic acid in the rumen. The predominant naturally occurring isomer is the cis-9, trans-11 modification. Treatment of linoleic acid-rich oils such as safflower oil, soybean oil, or maize oil with base and heat will result in the formation of CLA. Two isomers predominate in the synthetic preparation, c9,t11 and t10,c12. CLA has been shown to inhibit chemically-induced skin, stomach, mammary or colon tumours in mice and rats. The inhibition of mammary tumours in rats is effective regardless of type of carcinogen or type or amount of dietary fat. CLA has also been shown to inhibit cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits. When young animals (mice, pigs) are placed on CLA-containing diets after weaning they accumulate more body protein and less fat. Since CLA is derived from the milk of ruminant animals and is found primarily in their meat and in products derived from their milk there is a concerted world-wide effort to increase CLA content of milk by dietary means. Its effect on growth (less fat, more protein) is also a subject of active research. The mechanisms underlying the effects of CLA are still moot.

Clinical manifestations in relation to avocado ingestion were as follows: systemic anaphylaxis in seven patients, angioedema/urticaria in six, vomiting in two, bronchial asthma in one, and rhinoconjunctivitis in one. Skin prick test (SPT) with fresh avocado was positive in all patients with the Strong avocado variety (SAv) and in 14 patients with the Hass avocado variety (HAv). Our patient-associated sensitizations were as follows: 10 to latex, eight to chestnut, eight to banana, four to kiwi, and four to walnut. Avocado-sensitized patients with latex allergy were typically middle-aged women, professionally exposed to latex, who also exhibited frequent associated sensitizations to chestnut, banana, and other fruits. Specific IgE against avocado was demonstrated in 11 of our patients, by both commercial CAP and RAST with avocado extract coupled to nitrocellulose disks. Despite its lower protein content, SAv seems to be more allergenic than HAv, both in vivo and in vitro. On incubating a pool of sera from our patients with avocado, latex, chestnut, and banana extracts, a progressive RAST inhibition was obtained, with SAv- and chestnut-marked disks. This suggests the existence of common antigenic determinants among these allergens.

[INST]  Extract all food-related terms listed in the text:   Milk chocolate is rich in both sucrose and fat, and is therefore considered unsuitable for diabetics. Nevertheless there is little information on the metabolic effects of conventional chocolate or specialized formulations with reduced sucrose content. In the present study six male non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients (age range 35-60 years; body-mass index less than 28) consumed test meals of chocolate (75 g) on three separate occasions. The control chocolate contained sucrose (45.5% w/w); the test chocolates contained either fructose (45.5% w/w) or isomalt (45.1% w/w). The latter is a sweet disaccharide alcohol which has no glycaemic effect when consumed as a pure compound. Venous blood samples were obtained at 30 min intervals for 5 h, and analysed for glucose, insulin, lactate and triglycerides. All three chocolates provoked a sustained rise in blood glucose, which reached a maximum at 90 min after ingestion and returned to baseline values by 5 h. The highest blood glucose levels occurred after conventional chocolate, and differences were statistically significant at 60 and 90 min (P less than 0.05). The area under the glycaemic curve for isomalt chocolate was 36% smaller than that for conventional chocolate (P less than 0.05), and there were differences in insulin and lactate levels, consistent with the lower glycaemic effect. The glycaemic response to the fructose-based chocolate was also lower than that to control chocolate but the difference was not significant. All three chocolates led to a similar sustained rise in serum triglyceride levels. Isomalt appears to be a palatable alternative sweetener capable of reducing the glycaemic effect of diabetic confectionary.

Although the Japanese diet is associated with higher sodium intake and lower potassium intake, few studies have examined the source foods quantitatively. Studies on dietary patterns in association with potassium intake will be useful to provide dietary advice to increase potassium intake. Twenty-four-hour (hr) dietary recall data and 24-hr urinary potassium excretion data from Japanese participants (574 men and 571 women) in the International Study of Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP) were used to calculate food sources of potassium and compare food consumption patterns among quartiles of participants categorized according to 24-hr urinary potassium excretion per unit of body weight (UK/BW). The average potassium intake was 2791 mg/day per participant, and the major sources were vegetables and fruits (1262 mg/day), fish (333 mg/day), coffee and tea (206 mg/day), and milk and dairy products (200 mg/day). Participants in the higher UK/BW quartile consumed significantly more vegetables and fruits, fish, and milk and dairy products, and ate less rice and noodles.

Although the bioactive potential is linked to the composition, that is variable depending on mainly the botanical origin, honey has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, honey, administered alone or in combination with conventional therapy, might result useful in the management of chronic diseases that are commonly associated with oxidative stress and inflammation state. Obesity is a metabolic disorder characterized by visceral adiposity. The adipose tissue becomes hypertrophic and undergoes hyperplasia, resulting in a hypoxic environment, oxidative stress and production of pro-inflammatory mediators that can be responsible for other disorders, such as metabolic syndrome and neurodegeneration. Experimental evidence from animals have shown that honey improves glycemic control and lipid profile with consequent protection from endothelial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current literature concerning the beneficial effects of honey in the management of the obesity-related dysfunctions, including neurodegeneration. Based on the key constituents of honey, the paper also highlights polyphenols to be potentially responsible for the health benefits of honey.

Glutenin and gliadin are two major components of gluten that are essentially required for developing a strong protein network for providing desired viscoelasticity of dough. Many non-gluten cereals and starches (rice, corn, sorghum, millets, and potato/pea starch) and various gluten replacers (xanthan and guar gum) have been used for retaining the physical-sensorial properties of gluten-free, cereal-based products. This paper reviews the recent advances in the formulation of cereal-based, gluten-free products by utilizing alternate flours, starches, gums, hydrocolloids, enzymes, novel ingredients, and processing techniques. The pseudo cereals amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, are promising in gluten-free diet formulation. Genetically-modified wheat is another promising area of research, where successful attempts have been made to silence the gliadin gene of wheat using RNAi techniques. The requirement of quantity and quality for gluten-free packaged foods is increasing consistently at a faster rate than lactose-free and diabetic-friendly foods. More research needs to be focused on cereal-based, gluten-free beverages to provide additional options for CD sufferers.

[INST]  Identify all food entities mentioned in the text:   (1) Background: Aspects of the Mongolian food supply, including high availability of animal-source foods and few plant foods, are plausibly associated with disease in the population. Data on Mongolian diets are lacking, and these risks are poorly quantified. The purpose of this study was to provide a multifaceted nutritional analysis of the modern Mongolian diet. (2) Methods: The study population consisted of 167 male and 167 female healthy non-pregnant urban and nomadic adults (22-55 years) randomly selected from lists of residents in 8 regions. From 2011-2016, 3-day weighed diet records and serum were collected twice from each participant in summer and winter; anthropometry was collected once from each participant. Serum was analyzed for biomarkers, and nutrient intake computed using purpose-built food composition data and adjusted for within-person variation. Exploratory dietary patterns were derived and analyzed for associations with diet and nutrition measurements. (3) Results: We collected 1838 of an expected 1986 diet records (92.5%), 610/658 serum samples (92.7%), and 315/334 height and weight measurements (94.3%). Sixty-one percent of men and 51% of women were overweight or obese. Consumption of red meat, refined grains, and whole-fat dairy was high, while that of fruits, non-tuberous vegetables, eggs, nuts and seeds, fish and poultry, and whole grains was low. Dairy and red meat were more consumed in summer and winter, respectively. Dietary inadequacy of 10 of 21 assessed nutrients, including fiber, folate, and vitamin D were >50% prevalent, while protein, zinc, and vitamin B12 inadequacy were low. Biochemical evidence of iron and vitamin A deficiency was also low. Three dietary patterns (Urban, Transitional, Nomadic) explained 41% of variation in food consumption. The Urban pattern was positively associated with BMI in multivariate analysis. (4) Conclusions: Results indicate a high prevalence of key dietary inadequacies and overweight among Mongolian adults. Prior studies by our group have suggested that expanded supplementation and food fortification would be effective in addressing micronutrient inadequacies; these strategies should be coupled with measures to mitigate the growing burden of chronic disease.

Scores for dietary patterns were obtained by factor analysis in women from the French cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (1993-2000). Their association with colorectal tumors was investigated in 516 adenoma cases (175 high-risk adenomas) and 4,804 polyp-free women and in 172 colorectal cancer cases and 67,312 cancer-free women. The authors identified four dietary patterns: "healthy" (vegetables, fruit, yogurt, sea products, and olive oil); "Western" (potatoes, pizzas and pies, sandwiches, sweets, cakes, cheese, cereal products, processed meat, eggs, and butter); "drinker" (sandwiches, snacks, processed meat, and alcoholic beverages); and "meat eaters" (meat, poultry, and margarine). For quartile 4 versus quartile 1, an increased risk of adenoma was observed with high scores of the Western pattern (multivariate relative risk (RR) = 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.94; p(trend) = 0.03) and the drinker pattern (RR = 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.83; p(trend) = 0.01). The meat-eaters pattern was positively associated with colorectal cancer risk (for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: RR = 1.58, 95% confidence interval: 0.98, 2.53; p(trend) = 0.02).

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms contained in the text:   Observational studies support the role of modifying lifestyle-related risk factors such as diet, physical activity and alcohol use in stroke prevention. For example, increased Na intake is associated with hypertension, and reduction in salt consumption may significantly lower blood pressure and may reduce stroke mortality. Moderately elevated homocysteine levels may be associated with stroke and are associated with deficiency of dietary intake of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. Consumption of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, folate, K, Ca, Mg, dietary fibre, fish and milk may protect against stroke. Regular physical activity may also protect against stroke through its role in controlling various risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity. The role of fat intake as a risk factor for stroke remains uncertain, whereas the association between stroke and cholesterol has more convincingly been demonstrated by the recent intervention trials using statins. There is also evidence that a low serum albumin may be causally linked to stroke risk and outcome and that a significant number of stroke patients are undernourished on admission and their nutritional status deteriorates further whilst in hospital. Undernutrition is associated with increasing morbidity and mortality and nutritional supplements may have some beneficial effect on some outcome measures.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food-related terms in the text:   Nutrition is far more important in stroke risk than most physcians suppose. Healthy lifestyle choices reduce the risk of stroke by ~80%, and of the factors that increase the risk of stroke, the worst is diet: only ~0.1% of Americans consume a healthy diet, and only 8.3% consume a somewhat healthy diet. The situation is probably not much better in most other countries. A Cretan Mediterranean diet, high in olive oil, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, and low in cholesterol and saturated fat, can reduce stroke by 40% or more in high-risk patients. The role of the intestinal microbiome in cardiovascular risk is emerging; high levels of toxic metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria from meat (particularly red meat) and egg yolk are renally excreted. Patients with renal impairment, including the elderly, should limit red meat and avoid egg yolk, as should other patients at high risk of stroke. Salt intake should be limited to 2<U+207B>3 grams per day. Metabolic B12 deficiency is common and usually missed. It has serious neurological consequences, including an increase in the risk of stroke. It now clear that B vitamins to lower homocysteine reduce the risk of stroke, but we should probably be using methylcobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms contained in the text:   Recently, we demonstrated that spaghetti caused a significantly lower glycemic response in isoinsulinemic insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) subjects than an exchangeable amount of potato. The question is, however, whether the difference of the glucose response in IDDM patients is preserved if these carbohydrate-rich foods are taken as part of a mixed meal. To answer this question, we evaluated blood glucose, free-insulin, and glucagon responses to exchangeable amounts of spaghetti and potato when ingested together with bolognese sauce in seven IDDM patients who had attained euglycemia with the artificial pancreas before meal intake. The potato (200 g raw wt) with bolognese sauce (167 g) and spaghetti (50 g raw wt) with bolognese sauce (167 g) had approximately identical caloric content (435 and 447 kcal, respectively), fat (18 g each), protein (23 and 26 g, respectively), and carbohydrate (47 and 48 g, respectively). Blood glucose increment after white spaghetti and bolognese sauce was only approximately 50% of that seen in response to potato and bolognese sauce. Similar constant insulin levels and increments in glucagon were seen. A major determinant of the postmeal glucose rise in IDDM patients seems to be dependent on the kind of carbohydrate in the meal. The approach by which the insulinemia was kept constant by the artificial pancreas seems to be a valuable tool for studying glycemic responses to different meals in IDDM patients who otherwise show great variations in circulating insulin and glucose levels when treated by subcutaneously administered insulin.

Affected commodities include oats, wheat, maize, barley, raisins and other dried vine fruits, wine, beer, coffee, and cocoa. Although OTA has been shown to cause kidney disease, including kidney cancer, in multiple animal species, the impact of dietary OTA on human health from a global perspective has been less clear. Several epidemiological studies suggest an association between OTA exposure and human kidney disease, but evidence of causality has been limited. Nonetheless, because OTA is common in so many foodstuffs and may play a role in kidney disease, we consider it important to improve the body of evidence surrounding OTA's adverse effects to humans, as well as human dietary exposures in different parts of the world. This is especially true in the light of increasing type 2 diabetes and obesity prevalence worldwide; both conditions frequently lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), and may synergize with dietary OTA exposure to increase CKD risk.

We aimed to quantify the association between dietary patterns and gastric cancer, by location and histological type, according to Helicobacter pylori infection status. We analyzed 591 incident cases of gastric adenocarcinoma and 1,463 community controls. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Principal components and cluster analyses were used to define dietary patterns. Anti-H. pylori IgG was assessed by ELISA. Age-, gender-, education- and total energy intake-adjusted odds ratios (OR) were computed. Three dietary patterns were identified, with the following main characteristics: (I) high consumption of fruits and dairy products, and low consumption of alcoholic beverages; (II) low consumption of fruit, salads, vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat; (III) high consumptions of most food groups and low vegetable soup intake. Compared to pattern I, the risk of gastric cancer was higher for pattern II (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.31-2.14) but not for pattern III (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.57-1.14), with no effect modification by H. pylori infection. The association was similar for cardia and non-cardia gastric cancer, but for tumors of the diffuse Laur<U+00E9>n histological type, the association was weaker for pattern II vs. I (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 0.83-2.08) and a protective effect was observed for pattern III vs. I (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.22-0.87).

Seventeen of the 25 reported good tolerance to the ingestion of egg and chicken meat. The skin tests were negative to both antigens in 15 of them, and positive for egg in two. All 17 patients had negative RAST to chicken meat and egg protein. The remaining eight patients had intolerance to egg, and three of them also to chicken meat ingestion; in seven of the eight cases allergic to egg, the alimentary intolerance began after the clinical symptoms of bird feather sensitization. In all eight cases the skin tests were positive to egg yolk, and in five of them also to egg white and chicken meat. These patients evidenced specific serum IgE antibodies to egg yolk, four of them to egg white, and seven to chicken meat. These results demonstrate the high frequency (32%) of the association of sensitization to egg proteins, particularly egg yolk, in a selected population of patients with known allergy to bird feathers, thus suggesting that in some patients feather sensitization could trigger or somehow facilitate the later sensitization to egg yolk proteins.

[INST]  Find all food-related entities mentioned in the text:   Saturated vegetable oils (coconut, palm, and palm kernel oil) and fats (butter and lard) are hypercholesterolemic relative to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated vegetable oils. The increase in plasma low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations associated with consumption of saturated vegetable oils and fats is largely explained by a decrease in hepatic LDL receptor activity and an increase in the LDL-C production rate. Hepatic LDL receptor activity may be regulated by the messenger RNA concentration of the LDL receptor. The decrease in hepatic LDL receptor activity with saturated fat feeding is associated with decreased hepatic sterol O-acyltransferase activity and, therefore, a reduced inert pool of cholesteryl ester. A putative regulatory pool of cholesterol is increased with saturated fat feeding and suppresses LDL receptor activity, possibly through hepatic messenger RNA regulation. For most studies, an independent effect of a vegetable oil or fat could not be ascertained because there was no neutral control and at least two of the test oils or fats were varied. Animal data for the effects of individual fatty acids on plasma LDL-C concentrations and metabolism are sparse. The evidence suggests that caproic acid (6:0), caprylic acid (8:0), and capric acid (10:0) are neutral with respect to their LDL-C-raising properties and their ability to modulate LDL metabolism. Lauric acid (12:0), myristic acid (14:0), and palmitic acid (16:0) are approximately equivalent in their LDL-C-raising potential by reducing hepatic LDL receptor activity and increasing the LDL-C production rate, apparently via modulation of sterol O-acyltransferase activity. Stearic acid (18:0) appears to be neutral in its LDL-C-raising potential and how it affects LDL metabolism.

However, vegetables make up a heterogeneous group, and subgroups of vegetables may be differentially associated with MI. The aim of this study was to examine replacement of potatoes with other vegetables or subgroups of other vegetables and the risk of MI. Substitutions between subgroups of other vegetables and risk of MI were also investigated. We followed 29,142 women and 26,029 men aged 50-64 years in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort. Diet was assessed at baseline by using a detailed validated FFQ. Hazards ratios (HR) with 95% CI for the incidence of MI were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. During 13.6 years of follow-up, 656 female and 1,694 male cases were identified. Among women, the adjusted HR for MI was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.13) per 500 g/week replacement of potatoes with other vegetables. For vegetable subgroups, the HR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.13) for replacement of potatoes with fruiting vegetables and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.07) for replacement of potatoes with other root vegetables. A higher intake of cabbage replacing other vegetable subgroups was associated with a statistically non-significant higher risk of MI. A similar pattern of associations was found when intake was expressed in kcal/week. Among men, the pattern of associations was overall found to be similar to that for women.

The rate of MEC exfoliation can be assessed by measuring the milk MEC content through light microscopy, flow cytometry analysis, or an immuno-magnetic method for MEC purification. Various experimental models have been used to affect milk yield and study the rate of MEC exfoliation. Reducing milking frequency from twice to once daily did not seem to have any effect on MEC loss in goat and cow milk after 7 d, but increased MEC loss per day in goats when applied for a longer period. An increase in MEC exfoliation was also observed during short days as compared with long days, or in response to an endotoxin-induced mastitis in cows. Other animal models were designed to investigate the endocrine control of the exfoliation process and its link with milk production. Suppression of ovarian steroids by ovariectomy resulted in a greater persistency of lactation and a decrease in MEC exfoliation. Administering prolactin inhibitors during lactation or at dry-off enhanced MEC exfoliation, whereas exogenous prolactin during lactation tended to prevent the negative effect of prolactin inhibitors. These findings suggest that prolactin could regulate MEC exfoliation. In most of these studies, variations of MEC exfoliation were associated with variations in milk yield and changes in mammary epithelium integrity. Exfoliation of MEC could thus influence milk yield by regulating MEC number in mammary tissue.   [/INST] Of course, the entities regarding food are detailed below:  milk, goat and cow milk.

[INST]  Extract all food items from the text:   Several studies have investigated the role of diet as a risk and/or protective factor against thyroid cancer, both considering individual foods, groups of foods and dietary patterns, but the results are not consistent. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between dietary habits and thyroid cancer. Cases and controls were recruited at the University Hospital "G. Rodolico" of Catania. The dietary habits were defined through the "Lifestyle Assessment Questionnaire". The frequency of consumption of each food item was reported on a 4-level scale (never, one time a week, 2-3 times a week, every day of the week). We computed the odds ratios (ORs) of thyroid cancer and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the median of control group daily intake of each food group, using multiple logistic regression models adjusted for major confounding factors. Starchy foods (OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>1.39, 95% CI 0.83-2.32), sweets (OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>1.39, 95% CI 0.81-2.40) and products rich in salt and fat showed a positive association with thyroid cancer risk. Conversely, an inverse association with disease risk was found for vegetables (cruciferous OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.92, non cruciferous OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0.57 (0.20-1.57) milk and dairy products (OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0.68, 95% CI 0.40-1.13) and seafood (OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>0.68, 95% CI 0.34-1.22). An increased risk was observed for consumption of iodized salts (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.21-3.51), tea (OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>1.42, 95% CI 0.84-2.41) and coca-cola (OR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>3.08, 95% CI 1.53-6.20). Finally, our results confirm the protective effect of a daily water intake of 1-2<U+00A0>L, but unfortunately this quantity is usually consumed by about a quarter of the sample. Dietary habits appear to modify the risk of thyroid carcinoma. A diet with a limited consumption of starchy foods, products rich in salt, fat and sugar and a higher consumption of, cruciferous/non-cruciferous vegetables, milk and dairy products and seafood could be protective towards thyroid cancer. Moreover, the water intake should be increased and the actual need to consume iodized salt should be verified for each subject/area. These results warrant further investigations and, if confirmed, they might have important public health implications for the reduction of thyroid cancer through the improvement of dietary habits.

Here, we present a robust 10-plex quantitative and sensitive ligation-dependent probe amplification method, the allergen-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) method, for specific detection of eight allergens: sesame, soy, hazelnut, peanut, lupine, gluten, mustard, and celery. Ligated probes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and amplicons were detected using capillary electrophoresis. Quantitative results were obtained by comparing signals with an internal positive control. The limit of detection varied from approximately 5 to 400 gene copies, depending on the allergen. The method was tested using different foods spiked with mustard, celery, soy, or lupine flour in the 1-0.001% range. Depending on the allergen, sensitivities were similar or better than those obtained with qPCR. The allergen-MLPA method is modular and can be adapted by adding probe pairs for other allergens. The DNA-based allergen-MLPA method will constitute a complementary method to the traditional protein-based methods.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms referenced in the text:   Coloured (black, purple, blue, red, etc.) cereal grains, rich in anthocyanins, have recently gained a lot of attention in the food industry. Anthocyanins are water-soluble flavonoids, and are responsible for red, violet, and blue colours in fruits, vegetables, and grains. Anthocyanins have demonstrated antioxidant potential in both in vitro and in vivo studies, and the consumption of foods high in anthocyanins has been linked to lower risks of chronic diseases. As such, whole grain functional foods made with coloured grains are promising new products. This paper will review the characteristics of cereal anthocyanins, and assess their prevalence in various commercially relevant crops including wheat, barley, maize, and rice. A brief overview of the antioxidant potential, and current research on the health effects of cereal-based anthocyanins will be provided. Finally, processing of coloured cereals in whole grain products will be briefly discussed. A full understanding of the fate of anthocyanins in whole grain products, and more research targeted towards health outcomes of anthocyanin supplementation to/inclusion in cereal food products are the next logical steps in this research field.

We therefore investigated the association between vegetable and fruit consumption and the risk of bladder cancer among participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Data on food consumption and complete follow-up for cancer occurrence was available for a total of 478,533 participants, who were recruited in 10 European countries. Estimates of rate ratios were obtained by Cox proportional hazard models, stratified by age at recruitment, gender and study centre, and adjusted for total energy intake, smoking status, duration of smoking and lifetime intensity of smoking. A calibration study in a subsample was used to control for dietary measurement errors. After a mean follow-up of 8.7 years, 1015 participants were newly diagnosed with bladder cancer. Increments of 100 g/day in fruit and vegetable consumption combined did not affect bladder cancer risk (i.e., calibrated HR = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.95-1.01). Borderline statistically significant lower bladder cancer risks were found among never smokers with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables combined (HR = 0.94 95%CI: 0.87-1.00 with increments of 100 g/day; calibrated HR = 0.92 95%CI 0.79-1.06) and increased consumption of apples and pears (hard fruit; calibrated HR = 0.90 95%CI: 0.82-0.98 with increments of 25 g/day). For none of the associations a statistically significant interaction with smoking status was found. Our findings do not support an effect of fruit and vegetable consumption, combined or separately, on bladder cancer risk.

These assumptions, however, have recently been brought into question by current research on regular fat dairy products and human health. In an effort to disseminate, explore and discuss the state of the science on the relationship between regular fat dairy products and health, symposia were programmed by dairy industry organizations in Europe and North America at The Eurofed Lipids Congress (2014) in France, The Dairy Nutrition Annual Symposium (2014) in Canada, The American Society for Nutrition Annual Meeting held in conjunction with Experimental Biology (2015) in the United States, and The Federation of European Nutrition Societies (2015) in Germany. This synopsis of these symposia describes the complexity of dairy fat and the effects regular-fat dairy foods have on human health. The emerging scientific evidence indicates that the consumption of regular fat dairy foods is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and inversely associated with weight gain and the risk of obesity. Dairy foods, including regular-fat milk, cheese and yogurt, can be important components of an overall healthy dietary pattern. Systematic examination of the effects of dietary patterns that include regular-fat milk, cheese and yogurt on human health is warranted.

A low incidence for both cancers has been recorded in Mongolia and Bolivia. Discrepant data, however, have been reported for India, Japan and Korea. In India, the incidence of breast cancer is significantly higher than for colon cancer, in Japan and Korea colon cancer exceeds by far the rate of breast cancer. Here, studies are summarized pointing to a species-specific risk for colon cancer after consumption of beef originating from dairy cattle. Uptake of dairy products of Bos taurus-derived milk cattle, particularly consumed at early age, is suggested to represent one of the main risk factors for the development of breast cancer. A recent demonstration of reduced breast cancer rates in individuals with lactose intolerance (Ji et al., Br J Cancer 2014; 112:149-52) seems to be in line with this interpretation. Species-specific risk factors for these cancers are compatible with the transmission of different infectious factors transferred via meat or dairy products. Countries with discordant rates of colon and breast cancer reveal a similar discordance between meat and milk product consumption of dairy cattle. The recent isolation of a larger number of novel presumably viral DNAs from serum, meat and dairy products of healthy dairy cows, at least part of them infectious for human cells, deserves further investigation. Systemic infections early in life, resulting in latency and prevention of subsequent infections with the same agent by neutralizing antibodies, would require reconsideration of ongoing prospective studies conducted in the adult population.

We examined the association between vegetable and fruit intake and breast cancer risk in a hospital-based case-control study conducted in Guangdong, China. Four hundred and thirty-eight cases were frequency matched to 438 controls by age (5-year interval) and residence (rural/urban). Dietary intake was assessed by face-to-face interviews using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) after adjusting for various potential confounders. Total vegetable and fruit intake was found to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk. The ORs of the highest quartile relative to the lowest quartile of total vegetable and fruit intake were 0.28 (95% CI 0.18-0.43) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.34-0.82), respectively. Consumption of individual vegetable and fruit groups such as dark green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, carrots and tomatoes, banana, watermelon/papaya/cantaloupe were all inversely and significantly related with breast cancer risk. An inverse association was also observed for vitamin A, carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and fiber intake.

For this purpose, histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry for RUNX-2 and RANK-L were investigated in this setting. A total of 20 adult Wistar rats were distributed into four groups (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5), as follows: control group, cadmium group, cadmium and grape juice group, and Cadmium and apple juice group. Control group received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) water injection. Cadmium group received a single i.p. injection of cadmium chloride (1.2<U+00A0>mg/kg body weight) diluted in water. Cadmium and grape juice and cadmium and apple juice groups received a single i.p. injection of cadmium chloride (1.2<U+00A0>mg/kg body), and after 15<U+00A0>days, the rats were treated with grape or apple juices for 15<U+00A0>days, by gavage. All animals were euthanized 30<U+00A0>days after the beginning of experiment. Histopathological analysis in rat femur revealed extensive bone loss in rats intoxicated with cadmium. Grape or apple juices were able to increase bone formation. Cadmium inhibited RUNX-2 immunoexpression whereas cadmium increased RANK-L immunoexpression in rat bone cells. Grape or apple juices increased RUNX-2 and decreased RANK-L immunoexpression after cadmium intoxication. Taken together, our results demonstrate that grape or apple juices are able to exert therapeutic activity following cadmium intoxication in rat bone tissue as result of stimulatory effect of bone formation by RUNX-2 upregulation and RANK-L downregulation.

[INST]  Extract all food entities present in the text:   Groups of 18-21 male weanling C3H mice were given, as drinking fluid, tap-water, 12% ethanol solution, one of two commercial white wines, or red wine, ad lib. for 41 wk. Ethyl carbamate was added to each of the drinking liquids at levels adjusted to provide average daily ethyl carbamate intakes of 0, 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight. After 41 wk the cumulative survival of the mice given 20 mg ethyl carbamate/kg in water was depressed compared with the mice drinking wines or ethanol solution with this ethyl carbamate level. Both ethanol and wine treatments reduced the incidence of lung Clara-cell adenomas in mice given 10 mg ethyl carbamate/kg and reduced the frequency (number of specific tumours/number of tumour-bearing mice) of both Clara-cell adenomas in mice given 10 mg ethyl carbamate/kg and of alveolar adenomas in mice given 20 mg ethyl carbamate/kg. Wine treatments also reduced the frequency of hepatocellular adenomas compared with those of other treatment groups, and no hepatocellular carcinomas developed in any of the groups given wine, even with the 20-mg/kg ethyl carbamate dose. The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in the groups given 10 mg ethyl carbamate/kg was, as shown by chi-square analysis, significantly reduced by the ethanol and wine treatments. The mean weight gains of mice on all the wine treatments were lower than those of water-treated mice and this may have been a factor in tumour inhibition; however, it is also possible that wine components other than ethanol may play a role in the inhibition of tumour development.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   Although changes in Brazilian diet have occurred over the last decades, there is no evidence about differences in food portion sizes (FPS) over time. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association of FPS with excess body weight (EBW), and to monitor differences in the population from S<U+00E3>o Paulo, Brazil, from 2003 to 2015. Data came from three cross-sectional population-based studies with 5270 individuals aged <U+2265>12 years in 2003, 2008, and 2015. Dietary data were obtained from 24-h recalls. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between FPS and EBW. Over the years, there was a diverse variation in FPS, with an increase in some groups (white meat, salted snacks, coffee/tea, eggs) and decrease in others (rice, red meat, sweets, pasta, sandwiches, cold cuts). The percentage of people reporting the intake of six food groupings (rice, white meat, sweets, fruits, commercial juices, toasts/biscuits) increased in the period. In this population, EBW was associated with larger FPS of 11 of the 30 food groupings investigated (cold cuts, fried snacks, fruit and commercial juices, pizza, red meat, rice, salted snacks, soft drinks, soups, sugar). These findings could support future interventions and policies for optimal food intake in Brazil.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   From 1984 to 1988 a population-based case-control study was carried out in the Netherlands, in collaboration with the International Agency for Research on Cancer, to examine the possible relationship between the habitual lifetime consumption of alcohol, coffee and tea and exocrine pancreatic carcinoma in 176 cases and 487 controls. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain major life events and obtain estimates of consumption (ever-never) and frequency of consumption throughout life. Logistic regression analyses yielded odds ratios adjusted for age, sex, response status, smoking, dietary intake of energy and vegetables and of alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. When compared with data from non-drinkers, the cumulative lifetime consumption of all types of alcohol in grams of ethanol (ORs 1.00, 0.97, 0.93, 1.25, p trend 0.55), beer, spirits, red wine and fortified wine was not related to risk. The consumption of white wine was inversely associated with risk (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24-0.70). The uniformly reduced risk estimates for the lifetime number of drinks of white wine were based on small numbers (ORs 1.00, 0.44, 0.25, 0.40, p trend 0.001). When compared with data from non-drinkers, our findings suggest an inverse dose-response relationship for the lifetime consumption of coffee (ORs 1.00, 0.72, 0.37, 0.58, p trend 0.06), whereas lifetime consumption of tea and of ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee was not associated with risk. The absence of an effect of lifetime consumption of decaffeinated coffee may be due to the small numbers of subjects. These results further strengthen existing evidence against a positive association between consumption as well as lifetime consumption of (sources of) alcohol, tea or coffee and the development of exocrine pancreatic cancer.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   There is growing evidence that intakes of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), HFCS-sweetened soda, fruit drinks and apple juice - a high-fructose 100 % juice - are associated with asthma, possibly because of the high fructose:glucose ratios and underlying fructose malabsorption, which may contribute to enteral formation of pro-inflammatory advanced glycation end products, which bind receptors that are mediators of asthma. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations between intakes of these beverages and asthma risk, with data from the Framingham Offspring Cohort. Diet soda and orange juice - a 100 % juice with a 1:1 fructose:glucose ratio - were included for comparison. Increasing intake of any combination of HFCS-sweetened soda, fruit drinks and apple juice was significantly associated with progressively higher asthma risk, plateauing at 5-7 times/week v. never/seldom, independent of potential confounders (hazard ratio 1<U+00B7>91, P<0<U+00B7>001). About once a day consumers of HFCS-sweetened soda had a 49 % higher risk (P<0<U+00B7>011), moderate apple juice consumers (2-4 times/week) had a 61 % higher risk (P<0<U+00B7>007) and moderate fruit drink consumers had a 58 % higher risk (P<0<U+00B7>009), as compared with never/seldom consumers. There were no associations with diet soda/orange juice. These associations are possibly because of the high fructose:glucose ratios, and fructose malabsorption. Recommendations to reduce consumption may be inadequate to address asthma risk, as associations are evident even with moderate intake of these beverages, including apple juice - a 100 % juice. The juice reductions in the US Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in 2009, and the plateauing/decreasing asthma prevalence (2010-2013), particularly among non-Hispanic black children, may be related.

Strawberries, a rich source of phytochemicals (ellagic acid, anthocyanins, quercetin, and catechin) and vitamins (ascorbic acid and folic acid), have been highly ranked among dietary sources of polyphenols and antioxidant capacity. It should however be noted that these bioactive factors can be significantly affected by differences in strawberry cultivars, agricultural practices, storage, and processing methods: freezing versus dry heat has been associated with maximum retention of strawberry bioactives in several studies. Nutritional epidemiology shows inverse association between strawberry consumption and incidence of hypertension or serum C-reactive protein; controlled feeding studies have identified the ability of strawberries to attenuate high-fat diet induced postprandial oxidative stress and inflammation, or postprandial hyperglycemia, or hyperlipidemia in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors. Mechanistic studies have elucidated specific biochemical pathways that might confer these protective effects of strawberries: upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, downregulation of NF-kB activity and subsequent inflammation, or inhibitions of carbohydrate digestive enzymes. These health effects may be attributed to the synergistic effects of nutrients and phytochemicals in strawberries.

[INST]  Extract all food-related references from the text:   Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which causes hypercalcemia associated with malignant tumors, is known to be present in milk. Gene expression of PTHrP in the mammary gland increases markedly during parturition and with the onset of lactation. Even when circulating PTHrP levels are extremely low or below the detection limit, milk PTHrP levels are remarkably high. Parathyroid hormone-related protein derived from the mammary gland is assumed to play a role in maintaining the maternal calcium homeostasis and calcium transport from blood to milk. In previous studies that determined the PTHrP concentrations in milk, the pretreatments and diluent composition were not standardized. Here, we investigated the effect of various pretreatment procedures and diluent constitutions and the consequent PTHrP concentrations in commercial milk and milk products in Japan. Significant differences were found in PTHrP concentrations in raw milk samples subjected to different combinations of pretreatments (mixing, centrifugation, acidification, and heating) and diluents (0pM standard solution of PTHrP, plasma treated with protease inhibitors, and original diluent). We measured the PTHrP concentrations in normal liquid milk, processed milk, milk drinks, formulated milk powders, and skim milk powder by using the appropriate combination of pretreatment (acidification) and diluent (plasma treated with protease inhibitors). The PTHrP concentration in normal liquid milk, processed milk, and skim milk powder was as high as that in raw milk (>5nM), whereas that in milk drinks differed considerably. The PTHrP concentration in infant formulas (<2nM) was lower than that in the other milk products. These results indicate that a certain amount of PTHrP is ingested when milk and milk products are consumed.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms found in the text:   Individuals with celiac disease generally are advised to follow a lifelong gluten-free diet and avoid consumption of the prolamins gliadin (wheat), secalin (rye), and hordein (barley). Although the designation of the diet as glutenfree may imply that the diet contains zero gluten, this is not necessarily true. In some countries (eg, United States, Canada), the gluten-free diet is completely devoid of gluten and is based on foods such as rice and corn that are naturally gluten free. In others (eg, Scandinavia, United Kingdom), the gluten-free diet may include foods such as wheat starch that have been rendered gluten free but nonetheless contain small amounts of toxic prolamins. The discrepancy in the use of foods rendered gluten free exists because the amount of toxic prolamins that individuals with celiac disease may consume without damaging the mucosa of the small intestine is unknown. Minimal research has been conducted on the toxicity of foods rendered gluten free, and there are no definitive data about whether the small amount of prolamin found in these products is safe to consume. Nonetheless, the Codex Alimentarius Standard for gluten-free foods allows a certain amount of prolamin in foods designated gluten free, and these products have been used in many countries for several decades. Well-designed, scientifically sound studies are needed to help determine the amount of toxic prolamins, if any, that may be safely consumed by individuals with celiac disease. Until this research is conducted, dietitians in the United States should continue to advise their patients against the use of wheat starch and other foods rendered gluten free.

[INST]  Find all food entities present in the text:   Sepsis - syndrome of infection complicated by organ dysfunction - is responsible for over 750 000 hospitalisations and 200 000 deaths in the USA annually. Despite potential nutritional benefits, the association of diet and sepsis is unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the association between adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (Med-style diet) and long-term risk of sepsis in the REasons for Geographic Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. We analysed data from REGARDS, a population-based cohort of 30 239 community-dwelling adults age <U+2265>45 years. We determined dietary patterns from a baseline FFQ. We defined Med-style diet as a high consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, fish, cereal and low consumption of meat, dairy products, fat and alcohol categorising participants into Med-style diet tertiles (low: 0-3, moderate: 4-5, high: 6-9). We defined sepsis events as hospital admission for serious infection and at least two systematic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. We used Cox proportional hazard models to determine the association between Med-style diet tertiles and first sepsis events, adjusting for socio-demographics, lifestyle factors, and co-morbidities. We included 21 256 participants with complete dietary data. Dietary patterns were: low Med-style diet 32<U+00B7>0 %, moderate Med-style diet 42<U+00B7>1 % and high Med-style diet 26<U+00B7>0 %. There were 1109 (5<U+00B7>2 %) first sepsis events. High Med-style diet was independently associated with sepsis risk; low Med-style diet referent, moderate Med-style diet adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0<U+00B7>93 (95 % CI 0<U+00B7>81, 1<U+00B7>08), high Med-style diet adjusted HR=0<U+00B7>74 (95 % CI 0<U+00B7>61, 0<U+00B7>88). High Med-style diet adherence is associated with lower risk of sepsis. Dietary modification may potentially provide an option for reducing sepsis risk.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food-related terms in the text:   It has been postulated that the components in olive oil in the Mediterranean diet, a diet which is largely vegetarian in nature, can contribute to the lower incidence of coronary heart disease and prostate and colon cancers. The Mediterranean diet includes the consumption of large amounts of olive oil. Olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds. The major phenolic compounds in olive oil are oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. Recently there has been a surge in the number of publications that has investigated their biological properties. The phenolic compounds present in olive oil are strong antioxidants and radical scavengers. Olive "waste water" also possesses compounds which are strong antioxidant and radical scavengers. Typically, hydroxytyrosol is a superior antioxidant and radical scavenger to oleuropein and tyrosol. Hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein have antimicrobial activity against ATTC bacterial strains and clinical bacterial strains. Recent syntheses of labeled and unlabelled hydroxytyrosol coupled with superior analytical techniques have enabled its absorption and metabolism to be studied. It has recently been found that hydroxytyosol is renally excreted unchanged and as the following metabolites as its glucuronide conjugate, sulfate conjugate, homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Studies with tyrosol have shown that it is excreted unchanged and as its conjugates. This review summarizes the antioxidant abilities; the scavenging abilities and the biological fates of hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein and tyrosol which have been published in recent years.

[INST]  Identify all references to food present in the text:   Well-planned vegetarian diets are considered adequate for all stages of the life cycle, despite limited data on the zinc status of vegetarians during early childhood. The bioavailability of iron and zinc in vegetarian diets is poor because of their higher content of absorption inhibitors such as phytate and polyphenols and the absence of flesh foods. Consequently, children as well as adult vegetarians often have lower serum ferritin concentrations than omnivores, which is indicative of reduced iron stores, despite comparable intakes of total iron; hemoglobin differences are small and rarely associated with anemia. However, data on serum zinc concentrations, the recommended biomarker for identifying population groups at elevated risk of zinc deficiency, are sparse and difficult to interpret because recommended collection and analytic procedures have not always been followed. Existing data indicate no differences in serum zinc or growth between young vegetarian and omnivorous children, although there is some evidence of low serum zinc concentrations in vegetarian adolescents. Some vegetarian immigrants from underprivileged households may be predisposed to iron and zinc deficiency because of nondietary factors such as chronic inflammation, parasitic infections, overweight, and genetic hemoglobin disorders. To reduce the risk of deficiency, the content and bioavailability of iron and zinc should be enhanced in vegetarian diets by consumption of fortified cereals and milk, by consumption of leavened whole grains, by soaking dried legumes before cooking and discarding the soaking water, and by replacing tea and coffee at meals with vitamin C-rich drinks, fruit, or vegetables. Additional recommended practices include using fermented soy foods and sprouting at least some of the legumes consumed. Fortified foods can reduce iron deficiency, but whether they can also reduce zinc deficiency is less certain. Supplements may be necessary for vegetarian children following very restricted vegan diets.

[INST]  Extract all food items listed in the text:   Trans isomers of fatty acids, formed by the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils to produce margarine and vegetable shortening, increase the ratio of plasma low-density-lipoprotein to high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, so it is possible that they adversely influence risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). To investigate this possibility, we studied dietary data from participants in the Nurses' Health Study. We calculated intake of trans fatty acids from dietary questionnaires completed by 85,095 women without diagnosed CHD, stroke, diabetes, or hypercholesterolaemia in 1980. During 8 years of follow-up, there were 431 cases of new CHD (non-fatal myocardial infarction or death from CHD). After adjustment for age and total energy intake, intake of trans isomers was directly related to risk of CHD (relative risk for highest vs lowest quintile 1.50 [95% Cl 1.12-2.00], p for trend = 0.001). Additional control for established CHD risk factors, multivitamin use, and intakes of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and linoleic acid, dietary cholesterol, vitamins E or C, carotene, or fibre did not change the relative risk substantially. The association was stronger for the 69,181 women whose margarine consumption over the previous 10 years had been stable (1.67 [1.05-2.66], p for trend = 0.002). Intakes of foods that are major sources of trans isomers (margarine, cookies [biscuits], cake, and white bread) were each significantly associated with higher risks of CHD. These findings support the hypothesis that consumption of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils may contribute to occurrence of CHD.

A broader understanding of consumers' perceptions of low-calorie sweeteners is needed. This study examined two low-calorie sweeteners, tagatose and stevia, in comparison to sugar in dark chocolate. A total of 219 consumers participated in this study and rated overall liking and sensory attributes. Participants also listed their emotional conceptualisations upon consumption and were assessed on emotional eating behaviour and health and taste attitudes. The chocolate with tagatose was perceived as more similar to the chocolate with sugar than with stevia on overall liking, texture, bitterness, duration of aftertaste and intensity of aftertaste. Furthermore, chocolate with sugar and chocolate with tagatose both elicited positive emotional conceptualisations whereas chocolate with stevia elicited negative emotional conceptualisations.

[INST]  Locate all mentions of food in the text:   Garlic has been used medicinally since antiquity. In virtually every early civilization known, such as ancient India, Egypt, Rome, China, and Japan, garlic was part of the therapeutic regimen for a variety of maladies. Therefore, the ancient medicinal tradition of garlic use would qualify it as a folk medicine or as an alternative or complementary medicine. But is garlic an alternative to established methods of disease prevention or treatment? Scientists from around the world have identified a number of bioactive substances in garlic that are water soluble (e.g., S-allyl methylcysteine), and fat soluble (e.g., diallyldisulfide). Mechanisms of action are being elucidated by modern technology. The validity of ancient medicine is now being evaluated critically in cell-free systems, animal models, and human populations. Preventive and therapeutic trials of garlic are still in early stages. There are many promising lines of research suggesting the potential effects of garlic. The current state of knowledge does not recognize garlic as a true alternative, but it will likely find a place for garlic as a complement to established methods of disease prevention and treatment. Our goal should be to examine garlic together with other agents to evaluate its possible efficacy and toxicity under conditions of actual use in humans.

[INST]  Extract all food-related mentions from the text:   Raw and boiled aqueous extracts of garlic (Allium sativum) were administered daily to normal rats both orally and intraperitoneally for 4 wk. The serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. When the rats were treated with a low dose (50 mg/kg) of raw aqueous extract of garlic, no significant changes in the serum glucose levels were observed compared with the control group. However, there was a significant reduction in the cholesterol level of rats receiving a low dose of garlic (11-14%). Rats receiving garlic orally and intraperitoneally also showed a significant reduction in triglyceride levels (38%). When the rats were treated with a high dose (500 mg/kg) of raw garlic, glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were significantly affected. When boiled garlic extracts were administered at high concentrations (500 mg/kg), there was no effect on the level of serum glucose. However, a relatively small but significant decrease in the concentration of cholesterol and triglycerides was observed in the serum of the rats receiving boiled garlic. Raw garlic had a profound effect in reducing the glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, whereas boiled garlic had little effect in controlling these parameters.

[INST]  Find all mentions of food entities in the text:   Nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are nutrient dense foods with complex matrices rich in unsaturated fatty and other bioactive compounds: high-quality vegetable protein, fiber, minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds. By virtue of their unique composition, nuts are likely to beneficially impact health outcomes. Epidemiologic studies have associated nut consumption with a reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and gallstones in both genders and diabetes in women. Limited evidence also suggests beneficial effects on hypertension, cancer, and inflammation. Interventional studies consistently show that nut intake has a cholesterol-lowering effect, even in the context of healthy diets, and there is emerging evidence of beneficial effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular reactivity. Blood pressure, visceral adiposity and the metabolic syndrome also appear to be positively influenced by nut consumption. Thus it is clear that nuts have a beneficial impact on many cardiovascular risk factors. Contrary to expectations, epidemiologic studies and clinical trials suggest that regular nut consumption is unlikely to contribute to obesity and may even help in weight loss. Safety concerns are limited to the infrequent occurrence of nut allergy in children.

Dietary histories concerned the frequency of consumption per week of 29 selected food items (including the major sources of starches, proteins, fats, fibres, vitamins A and C, nitrates and nitrites in the Italian diet) and subjective scores for condiments and salt intake. Pasta and rice (the major sources of starch), polenta (a porridge made of maize) and ham were positively related with gastric cancer risk, whereas green vegetables and fresh fruit as a whole (and specifically citrus fruit) and selected fibre-rich aliments (such as whole-grain bread or pasta) showed protective effects on gastric cancer risk. Allowance for major identified potential distorting factors (chiefly indicators of socio-economic status) reduced the positive association with pasta or rice consumption, but did not appreciably modify any of the other risk estimates. When a single logistic model was fitted including all food items significant in univariate analysis, the 3 items remaining statistically significant were green vegetables (relative risk, RR = 0.27 for upper vs. lower tertile), polenta (RR = 2.32) and ham (RR = 1.60). Indices of beta-carotene and ascorbate intake were negatively and strongly related with gastric cancer risk, but the association with these micronutrients was no longer evident after simultaneous allowance for various food items.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items listed in the text:   This paper describes composition of dried plums and their products (prune juice and dried plum powder) with special attention to possibly bioactive compounds. Dried plums contain significant amounts of sorbitol, quinic acid, chlorogenic acids, vitamin K1, boron, copper, and potassium. Synergistic action of these and other compounds, which are also present in dried plums in less conspicuous amounts, may have beneficial health effects when dried plums are regularly consumed. Snacking on dried plums may increase satiety and reduce the subsequent intake of food, helping to control obesity, diabetes, and related cardiovascular diseases. Despite their sweet taste, dried plums do not cause large postprandial rise in blood glucose and insulin. Direct effects in the gastrointestinal tract include prevention of constipation and possibly colon cancer. The characteristic phenolic compounds and their metabolites may also act as antibacterial agents in both gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. The indirect salutary effects on bone turnover are supported by numerous laboratory studies with animals and cell cultures. Further investigation of phenolic compounds in dried plums, particularly of high molecular weight polymers, their metabolism and biological actions, alone and in synergy with other dried plum constituents, is necessary to elucidate the observed health effects and to indicate other benefits.

Several fruit allergens were used and characterized by protein determination and immunoblot techniques. Dose-dependent HR (apple peel = apple pulp > peach = cherry) was demonstrated in both allergic groups, but to a higher extent in patients with fruit allergy (P < 0.01). Increased basophil sensitivity to birch pollen was found in the group with fruit allergy (P < 0.001). Strong correlations between the mediator response induced by several fruits indicate common allergens within the extracts. We conclude that fruit-related symptoms require not only high specific serum IgE, but a strong cellular sensitization to birch pollen allergens together with an increased cellular reactivity to fruit allergens.

[INST]  Retrieve all food items listed in the text:   Metal contamination of urban soils and homegrown vegetables has caused major concern. Some studies showed that cadmium (Cd) was among the most significant hazards in kitchen garden soils and prolonged exposure to this metal could cause deleterious health effects in humans. In general, most risk assessment procedures are based on total concentrations of metals in vegetables. The present study assesses human bioaccessibility of Cd in vegetables cultivated in smelter-impacted kitchen garden soils. Seven vegetables (radish, lettuce, French bean, carrot, leek, tomato, and potato) were considered. Using the UBM protocol (unified BARGE bioaccessibility method), the bioaccessibility of Cd was measured in raw/cooked vegetables. A considerable amount of Cd was mobilized from raw vegetables during the digestion process (on average 85% in the gastric phase and 69% in the gastrointestinal phase), which could be attributed to a high uptake of Cd during the growth of the vegetables. Most Cd is accumulated in the vacuoles of plant cells, except what is absorbed by the cell wall, allowing Cd to be released from plant tissues under moderate conditions. Cooking by the steaming process generally increased the bioaccessibility of Cd in French bean, carrot, and leek. For potato, few or no significant differences of Cd bioaccessibility were observed after the steaming process, while the frying process strongly decreased bioaccessibility in both phases. The estimation of metal bioaccessibility in vegetables is helpful for human health risk assessment.

[INST]  Extract all references to food present in the text:   Extensive research within the past two decades has revealed that obesity, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, and other chronic diseases, is a proinflammatory disease. Several spices have been shown to exhibit activity against obesity through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Among them, curcumin, a yellow pigment derived from the spice turmeric (an essential component of curry powder), has been investigated most extensively as a treatment for obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases. Curcumin directly interacts with adipocytes, pancreatic cells, hepatic stellate cells, macrophages, and muscle cells. There, it suppresses the proinflammatory transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B, signal transducer and activators of transcription-3, and Wnt/beta-catenin, and it activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and Nrf2 cell-signaling pathways, thus leading to the downregulation of adipokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, resistin, leptin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and the upregulation of adiponectin and other gene products. These curcumin-induced alterations reverse insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and other symptoms linked to obesity. Other structurally homologous nutraceuticals, derived from red chili, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, and ginger, also exhibit effects against obesity and insulin resistance.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   Shellfish, including various species of mollusks (e.g., clams, oysters, and mussels) and crustaceans (e.g., shrimp and crab), have been a cornerstone of healthy dietary recommendations. However, beyond providing basic nutrition needs, their health-promoting effects have been suggested to include inflammation reduction and prevention of various chronic non-communicable<U+00A0>diseases. Currently, studies on the association between shellfish consumption and health outcomes have reported conflicting results. The present comprehensive review summarized the latest studies on shellfish consumption and synthesized the available evidence on the potential health benefits or risks of shellfish consumption. The findings demonstrated that shellfish consumption may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout but may not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and thyroid cancer. Adequate evidence is lacking on the association between shellfish consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral cancer, endometriosis, hip fracture, cognitive function, wheeze, eczema and food allergy. Raw shellfish consumption may cause gastroenteritis and other diseases infected by bacteria or viruses. This review thus provides consumers and other relevant stakeholders with the latest evidence-based information on the potential benefits and risks of shellfish consumption.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   Traditional analysis of food intake usually fails to show an association between energy and nutrient intake and indicators of obesity. The analysis of food patterns can contribute to the understanding of the association between eating habits and anthropometric indicators. A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out on a low-income neighbourhood in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, and 1009 subjects between 20 and 65 years of age completed an FFQ. Dietary patterns were identified by means of factor analysis, and their associations with BMI and waist circumference (WC) were ascertained by applying a linear regression analysis. Three main dietary patterns were identified: a mixed pattern, which included cereals, fish and shrimp, vegetables, roots, fruits, eggs, meat and caffeinated beverages; a Western pattern, which consisted of 'fast foods', soft drinks, juices, cakes, cookies, milk and dairy, sweets and snacks; a traditional pattern, which included rice, beans, bread, sugar, fats and salad dressings. After adjusting for age and energy intake, we found that the traditional dietary pattern was inversely associated with BMI (beta = - 1.14, P < 0.001) and WC (beta = - 14.9, P = 0.002) among females. Additionally, a positive association between the Western pattern and WC (beta = 12.8, P = 0.02) was observed for females.

However, thorough reviews on the efficacy of cocoa on brain processes in young adults do not exist precisely due to the limited number of studies in the matter. Thus, the aim of this study was to summarize the findings on the acute and chronic effects of cocoa administration on cognitive functions and brain health in young adults. Web of Science and PubMed databases were used to search for relevant trials. Human randomized controlled studies were selected according to PRISMA guidelines. Eleven intervention studies that involved a total of 366 participants investigating the role of cocoa on cognitive performance in children and young adults (average age <U+2264> 25 years old) were finally selected. Findings from individual studies confirm that acute and chronic cocoa intake have a positive effect on several cognitive outcomes. After acute consumption, these beneficial effects seem to be accompanied with an increase in cerebral blood flow or cerebral blood oxygenation. After chronic intake of cocoa flavanols in young adults, a better cognitive performance was found together with increased levels of neurotrophins. This systematic review further supports the beneficial effect of cocoa flavanols on cognitive function and neuroplasticity and indicates that such benefits are possible in early adulthood.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   Higher dietary energy density (DED) has been reported to be associated with weight gain, obesity and poorer dietary quality, yet nationally representative estimates that would allow tracking of secular trends and inter-country comparisons are limited. The aims of the present study were to calculate DED estimates for the Irish population and to identify dietary determinants of DED. Weighed/semi-weighed food records from three cross-sectional surveys (the National Children's Food Survey, the National Teens' Food Survey and the National Adult Nutrition Survey) were collated to estimate habitual dietary intakes for a nationally representative sample of the Irish population, aged 5-90 years (n 2535). DED estimates, calculated using the total diet method, the food only method and a novel method, including foods and solids in beverages, were 3<U+00B7>70 (sd 1<U+00B7>09), 7<U+00B7>58 (sd 1<U+00B7>72) and 8<U+00B7>40 (sd 1<U+00B7>88) kJ/g, respectively. Determinants of DED did not vary by the calculation method used. Variation in the intakes of fruit, vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) across consumer groups contributed to the largest variance in DED estimates, followed by variation in the intakes of potatoes, fresh meat, bread, chips, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, and confectionery. DED estimates were inversely associated with age group and consistently lower for females than for males. The inverse association of DED with age group was explained by higher intakes of vegetables, fruit, fish, potatoes, fresh meat and brown bread and lower intakes of SSB, chocolate confectionery, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and savoury snacks in older age groups. Females consumed, on average, 1<U+00B7>5 times more fruit and vegetables combined when compared with males, largely explaining the sex differences in DED estimates.

To obtain an average plasma cholesterol concentration of 20 mmol/l in each rabbit during the 13-week cholesterol-feeding period, dietary cholesterol was adjusted weekly. The amount of fat fed daily was 10 g per rabbit in Expts A (n 23), C (n 36), and D (n 58) and 5 g per rabbit in Expt B (n 24). The source of monounsaturated fatty acids was olive oil in all four experiments. The source of saturated fatty acids was butter in Expt A, lard in Expt B, coconut oil in Expt C, and butter or lard in Expt D. Generally, olive oil-fed groups received more cholesterol and tended to have more cholesterol in VLDL and less in LDL compared with groups receiving saturated fat. Analysis of variance of the combined results of all four experiments showed that, in comparison with saturated fat, olive oil lowered aortic cholesterol by 13 (-9-30, 95% confidence interval) % in the aortic arch, and by 10 (-10-26) % in the thoracic aorta, which was not significant. In the comparison with olive oil, no differences in effects on aortic cholesterol content were detected between butter, lard and coconut oil. These findings do not support the view that replacement of dietary saturated fat with olive oil has a major impact on the development of atherosclerosis in addition to that accounted for by changes in plasma cholesterol levels.

Cases (N = 148) were married men ages 20 through 74 years diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from July 1982 through June 1986. Controls (N = 188) were identified by random digit dialing. Wives, responding as surrogates for both cases and controls, were interviewed by telephone and completed, alone, a food frequency questionnaire. The risk of pancreatic cancer was increased in individuals with a history of diabetes or pancreatitis, and decreased in those with a history of tonsillectomy. Individuals who had ever smoked cigarettes were at elevated risk of disease. This excess risk was confined to current smokers, in whom the odds ratio was 3.2 (95% CI 1.8-5.7); the risk among former smokers resembled that in those who had never smoked. There was no excess risk of pancreatic cancer among those who had ever used other forms of tobacco, including pipe tobacco, cigars and chewing tobacco. After adjustment for demographic and dietary characteristics, there was no association between pancreatic cancer risk and the intake of coffee, beer, red wine, hard liquor or all alcohol combined; a slight reduction in risk was seen among those consuming white wine daily.

Cinnamon was the most bioactive product followed by witch hazel, green and black teas, allspice, bay leaves, nutmeg, cloves, mushrooms, and brewer's yeast. The glucose oxidation enhancing bioactivity was lost from cinnamon, tea, witch hazel, cloves, bay leaf and allspice by poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) treatment, indicating that the active phytochemicals are likely to be phenolic in nature. The activity of sage, mushrooms, and brewers's yeast was not removed by PVP. Some products such as Korean ginseng, flaxseed meal, and basil have been reported to be effective antidiabetic agents; however, they were only marginally active in our assay. Our technique measures direct stimulation of cellular glucose metabolism, so it may be that the active phytochemicals in these plants improve glucose metabolism via other mechanisms or that this in vitro screening is not a reliable predictor of hypoglycemic effects in vivo for some products. In summary, the positive effects of specific plant extracts on insulin activity suggest a possible role of these plants in improving glucose and insulin metabolism.

[INST]  Identify all references to food present in the text:   Dairy products have an important role in a healthy diet due to their high-quality protein and rich micronutrients. Yogurt, a fermented milk product, has a similar composition to milk but is a more concentrated product in terms of group B vitamins, minerals, and proteins. It is known that bioactive metabolites and live enzymes that occur by fermentation and digestion, affect the health positively by improving gut microbiota. In recent years, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, which threatens public health, is increasing rapidly. As with other noninfectious diseases, the diet has an important effect on the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. It has been demonstrated that yogurt has a high-quality amino acid pattern, reduces energy intake by stimulating satiety, and regulates blood glucose level. In addition to the rich protein variety, yogurt also contains peptides that positively affect blood pressure. Unlike milk, increased acidity during the fermentation of yogurt positively affects calcium absorption. Calcium plays an important role in the control of blood glucose and energy metabolism through insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent routes. In addition to reducing inflammation, calcium has a positive effect on the regulation of the blood lipid profile by increasing fecal fat excretion. There are many lipid and lipoid nutrients such as saturated fatty acids, phospholipids, sphingolipids, and conjugated linoleic acid that may affect the blood lipid profile in yogurt positively or negatively. There are seen very few randomized controlled studies that are focused on the relationship between yogurt and metabolic syndrome, and these are based on contradictory results. In this review, based on the clinical studies conducted to date, and the nutrient content of yogurt, possible mechanisms of these contradictory results are investigated.

Sex specific standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of stroke (1969-83) was calculated for each trichotomized food expenditure subgroup and compared. Results indicated that Western style diet such as expenditure of meat, milk and egg and bread had negative association with SMR. The expenditure of meat showed a negative association with SMR in all the three rice expenditure subgroups, but that of milk and egg in the low rice expenditure subgroup only. Consumption of constituents of the traditional Japanese diet, such as rice and other cereals, certain seasonings, salted and dried fish showed a positive association with SMR. Alcoholic beverages and cakes also showed a positive association. The secular trend of declining stroke mortality was parallel to the increase in the consumption of milk, meat, fish, eggs, soybeans, oil and fats and to the decrease in rice consumption.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 338 of 456 eligible histologically confirmed gastric-cancer cases and 669 of 880 eligible control subjects, sampled from population registers and frequency-matched by age and gender. We focused on 2 periods, adolescence and 20 years prior to interview. The association of gastric-cancer risk with dietary habits during adolescence were similar to that found for the period 20 years before interview; high consumption of wholemeal bread, fruit and vegetables was associated with reduced gastric-cancer risk. In addition, cheese, fish and tea had a protective effect during adolescence. Increased gastric-cancer risk was related to whole-milk consumption, but this association decreased substantially in a multivariate analysis including vegetables. There was a positive relationship between gastric-cancer risk and the age at which the interviewees started using refrigerators. This population-based study confirmed the protective effect of a high consumption of vegetables and fruit in the development of gastric cancer, but failed to find any association between intake of meat, sausage, cold cuts, liver, salt, coffee, the habit of frying, smoking or grilling foods, and risk of gastric cancer.

A random sample of 1153 individuals, aged 18-69 years, was recruited to participate in the cross-sectional Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg study. Chocolate consumption (g/d) was obtained from a semi-quantitative FFQ. Blood glucose and insulin levels were used for the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Hepatic biomarkers such as serum <U+03B3>-glutamyl-transpeptidase (<U+03B3>-GT), serum aspartate transaminase and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (mg/l) were assessed using standard laboratory assays. Chocolate consumers (81<U+00B7>8 %) were more likely to be younger, physically active, affluent people with higher education levels and fewer chronic co-morbidities. After excluding subjects taking antidiabetic medications, higher chocolate consumption was associated with lower HOMA-IR (<U+03B2>=-0<U+00B7>16, P=0<U+00B7>004), serum insulin levels (<U+03B2>=-0<U+00B7>16, P=0<U+00B7>003) and <U+03B3>-GT (<U+03B2>=-0<U+00B7>12, P=0<U+00B7>009) and ALT (<U+03B2>=-0<U+00B7>09, P=0<U+00B7>004), after adjustment for age, sex, education, lifestyle and dietary confounding factors, including intakes of fruits and vegetables, alcohol, polyphenol-rich coffee and tea. This study reports an independent inverse relationship between daily chocolate consumption and levels of insulin, HOMA-IR and liver enzymes in adults, suggesting that chocolate consumption may improve liver enzymes and protect against insulin resistance, a well-established risk factor for cardiometabolic disorders. Further observational prospective research and well-designed randomised-controlled studies are needed to confirm this cross-sectional relationship and to comprehend the role and mechanisms that different types of chocolate may play in insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disorders.

[INST]  Extract all food-related terms listed in the text:   The potential beneficial effects of plant-based diets on human health have been extensively studied. However, the evidence regarding the health effects of extracted plant-based proteins as functional ingredients, other than soya, is scarce. The aim of this review was to compile evidence on the effects of extracted protein from a wide range of traditional and novel plant sources on glycemic responses, appetite, body weight, metabolic, cardiovascular and muscle health. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was conducted through 23 and 27 March 2020 for randomized controlled trials that featured any of the following 18 plant protein sources: alfalfa, duckweed, buckwheat, chickpea, fava bean, hemp, lentil, lupin, mushroom, oat, pea, potato, pumpkin, quinoa, rapeseed, rice, sacha inchi, sunflower. Only interventions that investigated concentrated, isolated or hydrolysed forms of dietary protein were included. Searched health outcome measures were: change in blood glucose, insulin, satiety hormones concentration, subjective assessment of appetite/satiety, change in blood lipids concentration, blood pressure, body weight and muscle health parameters. Acute and sub-chronic studies were considered for inclusion. Applying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach we identified 1190 records.

Hamsters (n = 32) were divided into 4 groups of 8 and fed an atherogenic diet for 8 wk. They received by force- feeding 7.14 mL/(kg. d) PE in 2.6 mol/L ethanol (E + PE) or PE in water (W + PE), mimicking a moderate consumption of red wine or alcohol-free red wine [30.4 mg/(kg. d)], or 2.6 mol/L ethanol (E-PE) or water (W-PE) as their respective controls. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were lower in groups that consumed PE. The decrease in plasma apolipoprotein (Apo) B concentration was due mainly to PE and was significantly lower in Group E + PE than in Group E-PE (-7.5%) and in Group W + PE than in Group W-PE (-40%). Apo-A1 was not affected. PE significantly increased plasma antioxidant capacity by 9% in Group E + PE and 18% in Group W + PE compared with their respective controls. Liver glutathione peroxidase activity was 67% greater in the group receiving PE in water compared with the group given water; there was no effect when PE was given in ethanol relative to its control. Aortic fatty streak area (AFSA) was significantly reduced in the groups receiving PE in ethanol (-32%) or PE in water (-29%) in comparison with their respective controls. Ethanol significantly reduced AFSA by 60% (Group E-PE vs. Group W-PE) or 62% (Group E + PE vs. Group W + PE). These data suggest that ethanol is a complementary component of phenolics in the benefits of red wine for hamsters and that chronic ingestion of PE in ethanol prevents the development of atherosclerosis through several mechanisms. With moderate consumption of red wine, ethanol can improve the effects of phenolic compounds. However, alcohol-free red wine appears to be a very good alternative to red wine.

Cancer cases (n = 419) were identified through the Utah Cancer Registry, and controls (n = 889) were obtained through random digit dialing and the Health Care Financing Administration. After adjustment for cigarette smoking, age, sex, history of diabetes, and history of bladder infections using multiple logistic regression analysis, total fluid intake was not found to be related to bladder cancer development. Specific fluids related to bladder cancer risk were milk intake (OR = 0.64) and caffeinated coffee intake (OR = 1.60). A linear trend for a dose-response protective effect was observed for milk, while coffee increased risk only when 40 or more cups were consumed per week. Alcohol increased risk only when consumed at high levels (over 3.64 ounces or 103 g per week) by people who never smoked cigarettes (OR = 2.37). Likewise, tea consumption in non-cigarette smokers increased bladder cancer risk (OR = 2.25). Results from this study suggest that types of fluids consumed may play a role in the development of bladder cancer. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the dietary components of these beverages may be related to the development of bladder cancer.

In a hospital-based case-control study for type 2 diabetes in Kumasi (diabetes cases, 538; controls, 668) dietary intake was assessed by a specific food frequency questionnaire. After random split of our study population, we derived a dietary pattern in the training set using RRR with adiponectin, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides as responses and 35 food items as predictors. This pattern score was applied to the validation set, and its association with type 2 diabetes was examined by logistic regression. The dietary pattern was characterized by a high consumption of plantain, cassava, and garden egg, and a low intake of rice, juice, vegetable oil, eggs, chocolate drink, sweets, and red meat; the score correlated positively with serum triglycerides and negatively with adiponectin. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of type 2 diabetes for the highest quintile compared to the lowest was 4.43 (95% confidence interval: 1.87-10.50, p for trend < 0.001). The identified dietary pattern increases the odds of type 2 diabetes in urban Ghanaians, which is mainly attributed to increased serum triglycerides.

[INST]  Identify all mentions of food present in the text:   Dietary red and processed meats may increase risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), whereas fiber may be protective. Recently, we demonstrated that dietary beef causes greater colonic DNA strand breakage than equivalent levels of chicken in rats and that resistant starch (RS) as 20% high amylose maize starch (HAMS) attenuated the damage. From that study, we now report measures of circulating factors that may influence CRC initiation or progression including malondialdehyde (MDA), leptin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2), interleukins (IL), and short chain fatty acids. MDA levels were increased by beef diets relative to the chicken diets. Leptin concentrations, which were lower for chicken than beef at the 35% level in the absence of HAMS, were lowered by HAMS. Higher dietary chicken (but not beef) increased IGF-I irrespective of HAMS feeding. Higher levels of chicken resulted in greater insulin concentrations than for beef in rats fed HAMS. Without dietary HAMS, TIMP-2 concentration increased in response to both meats but was highest for chicken. MMP-2 and TIMP-2 concentrations were higher for HAMS diets. IL-1beta and IL-12 concentrations were lowered by HAMS feeding. Colonic DNA strand breakage was positively associated with circulating leptin and MDA concentrations as well as tissue MDA concentrations and negatively associated with plasma TIMP-2 concentration. MMP-2 and TIMP-2 positively correlated with hepatic portal butyrate levels but leptin concentrations correlated negatively. These results suggest diets high in meat or RS could influence cancer initiation or progression by changes in circulating levels of hormones and other factors.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food-related terms from the text:   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a commonly used method for the detection of trace amounts of potentially allergenic protein residues in foods. However, food matrices and processing conditions can affect the detection of protein residues. The effects of acidity on the detectability of several allergenic proteins commonly found in salad dressing using ELISAs was investigated. First, recovery experiments were performed on salad dressing formulated with 0 to 1000 ppm mustard flour (mustard). The mean percent recovery for mustard from the salad dressing was only 7.7%+/- 1.6%. When the pH of the salad dressing was adjusted to pH 7 prior to spiking with mustard, recovery improved to 94.1%+/- 7.6%. However, if the pH was adjusted to pH 7 after spiking and extraction, the recovery was only 11.1%+/- 1.7%. When vinegar was spiked with mustard flour at pH 3, 3.5, and 4, detectability of mustard was lowest at pH 3. Basic extraction of mustard proteins from salad dressing did not improve the mustard detection. Acidic salad dressing matrices reduced the detectability of mustard by the mustard ELISA probably because of acid precipitation of mustard proteins that renders them insoluble and nonextractable. Commercial salad dressings containing 100 ppm (mg/kg) of egg, milk, or gluten were analyzed every 2 to 4 d for 90 d using 3 commercially available ELISAs. A decrease in the detection of the egg, milk, and gluten in the salad dressing upon storage was observed. Our study highlighted the importance of evaluating the utility of various ELISAs for specific food matrices and the recovery as a function of product storage.

Increased risks were found for more frequent intake of meat [odds ratio (OR) in the highest vs. lowest consumption tertile = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-2.0], milk (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), fresh fruit (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.1), and vegetables (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.9-2.2). After allowance for the reciprocal confounding effect of various dietary habits, only frequent intake of milk seemed to be a significant independent indicator of prostatic cancer risk. There was also a clue that the unfavorable influence of frequent intake of a few food items (i.e. meat, fish, liver, ham and salami, milk and butter, and retinol) may be greater or restricted to older individuals (i.e., > or = 70 yrs of age). In conclusion, the present study confirms the presence of a moderate adverse effect of high intake of foods of animal origin, chiefly milk, while it suggests that a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables does not convey a protection.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   Fermented milk is a potential source of various biologically active peptides with specific health benefits. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE-I) peptides are one of the most studied bioactive peptides produced during milk fermentation. The presence of these peptides is reported in various fermented milk products such as, yoghurt, cheese, sour milk, etc., which are also available as commercial products. Many of the ACE-I peptides formed during milk fermentation are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the rennin angiotension system (RAS). There are various factors, which affect the formation ACE-I peptides and their ability to reach the target tissue in active form, which includes type of starters (lactic acid bacteria (LAB), yeast, etc.), substrate composition (casein type, whey protein, etc.), composition of ACE-I peptide, pre and post-fermentation treatments, and its stability during gastrointestinal digestion. The antihypertensive effect of fermented milk products has also been proved by various in vitro and in vivo (animal and human trials) experiments. This paper reviews the literature on fermented milk products as a source of ACE-I peptides and various factors affecting the production and activity of ACE-I peptides.

This study was done on 208 histologically confirmed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and 401 control subjects who were in the hospital for acute, nonimmunologic, or neoplastic conditions. Dietary histories concerned the frequency of consumption per week of alcohol, beverages that contain methylxanthine, and 14 select food items or groups of foods (including major sources of proteins, fat, fibers, and vitamin A in the Italian diet). The consumption of milk, liver, butter, oil (chiefly polyunsaturated oils), coffee, tea, and cola was positively related with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk. the consumption of whole-grain bread and pasta showed a protective effect. When a logistic model was fitted that included the aforementioned food items in addition to major nondietary covariates, all of the foods, except liver and beverages that contain methylxanthine, remained significant. Interestingly, these associations are in agreement with the positive correlation that is emerging internationally between the consumption of fat and proteins and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

[INST]  Extract all food-related mentions from the text:   The liver plays an outsized role in oncology. Liver tumors are one of the most frequently found tumors in cancer patients and these arise from either primary or metastatic disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent form of primary liver cancer and the 6th most common cancer type overall, is expected to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer mortality in the US by the year 2030. The liver is also the most common site of distant metastasis from solid tumors. For instance, colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasizes to the liver in two-thirds of cases, and CRC liver metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in these patients. The interplay between inflammation and cancer is unmistakably evident in the liver. In nearly every case, HCC is diagnosed in chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis background. The consumption of a Western-style high-fat diet is a major risk factor for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), both of which are becoming more prevalent in parallel with the obesity epidemic. Excessive alcohol intake also contributes significantly to the CLD burden in the form of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Inflammation is a key component in the development of all CLDs. Additionally, during the development of liver metastasis, pro-inflammatory signaling is crucial in eliminating invading cancer cells but ironically also helps foster a pro-metastatic environment that supports metastatic seeding and colonization. Here we review how Westernized high-fat diets and excessive alcohol intake can influence inflammation within the liver microenvironment, stimulating both primary and metastatic liver tumorigenesis.

The aim of this study was to investigate substitutions of red meat, poultry and fish with vegetables or potatoes for MI prevention. We followed up 29 142 women and 26 029 men in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study aged 50-64 years with no known history of MI at baseline. Diet was assessed by a validated 192-item FFQ at baseline. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI for MI associated with specified food substitutions of 150 g/week. During a median follow-up of 13<U+00B7>6 years, we identified 656 female and 1694 male cases. Among women, the HR for MI when replacing red meat with vegetables was 0<U+00B7>94 (95 % CI 0<U+00B7>90, 0<U+00B7>98). Replacing fatty fish with vegetables was associated with a higher risk of MI (HR 1<U+00B7>23; 95 % CI 1<U+00B7>05, 1<U+00B7>45), whereas an inverse, statistically non-significant association was found for lean fish (HR 0<U+00B7>93; 95 % CI 0<U+00B7>83, 1<U+00B7>05). Substituting poultry with vegetables was not associated with risk of MI (HR 1<U+00B7>00; 95 % CI 0<U+00B7>90, 1<U+00B7>11). Findings for substitution with potatoes were similar to findings for vegetables. Among men, a similar pattern was observed, but the associations were weak and mostly statistically non-significant.

[INST]  Extract all food entities listed in the text:   Sorghum is the fifth cereal most produced in the world after wheat, rice, maize, and barley. In some regions, this crop is replacing maize, due to its high yield, resistance to drought and heat. There are several varieties of sorghum, whose coloration varies from cream, lemon-yellow, red, and even black. Pigmented sorghum grain is a rich source of antioxidants like polyphenols, mainly tannins, which have multiple benefits on human health such as, antiproliferative properties associated with the prevention of certain cancers, antioxidant activities related to the prevention of associated diseases to oxidative stress, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, it also improves glucose metabolism. Despite having these types of compounds, it is not possible to assimilate them, their use in the food industry has been limited, since sorghum is considered a food of low nutritional value, due to the presence of anti-nutritional factors such as strong tannins which form complexes with proteins and iron, thus reducing their digestibility. Based on these restrictions that this product has had as food for humans, the analysis of this review emphasizes the valorization of sorghum as a source of bioactive substances and the importance they confer on human health because of the biological potential it has.

To study the association between fruits and vegetables and risk of RCC in a population-based prospective cohort study of Swedish women, we collected dietary information from 61,000 women age 40-76 years by a food-frequency questionnaire. During 13.4 years of follow-up 122 women developed RCC. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Women consuming 5 or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily had a relative risk of 0.59 (95% CI = 0.26-1.34) in comparison to them consuming less than once daily. When fruits and vegetables were examined separately, those who consumed more than 75 servings per month of fruits or vegetables had multivariate relative risk of 0.59 (95% CI = 0.27-1.25) and 0.60 (95% CI = 0.31-1.17) respectively, compared to those consuming 11 or less servings per month. Within the group of fruits, the strongest inverse association was observed for banana (p = 0.07 by Wald test). The risk of RCC increased monotonically with increasing intake frequencies of fruit juice (p-value for trend = 0.10). Within the group of vegetables, the strongest inverse association was observed for root vegetables (p = 0.03 by Wald test). The risk of RCC decreased with increasing consumption frequencies of white cabbage (p for trend = 0.07). Frequent consumption of salad vegetables (once or more per day) decreased the risk by 40% (RR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.30-1.22), in comparison to no consumption.

[INST]  Identify all food-related terms included in the text:   Little information is available about how fluid intake from beverages and sources of fluid intake influence risk of rectal cancer. We examined these associations with risk of incident rectal cancer in a population-based case-control study of 952 cases and 1,205 controls living in northern California and Utah. We also determined if intake of fiber (soluble and insoluble), physical activity, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) or aspirin modified the associations between fluid intake and rectal cancer. We identified a modest inverse association of water intake (odds ratio, OR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.48, 1.02) and total fluid intake (high vs. low OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.46, 1.06) with risk of rectal cancer in men and a positive association with juice among women (high vs. low OR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.00, 2.41). Risk of rectal cancer increased nonsignificantly among men with beer consumption, among women with high white wine use, and among men and women with high long-term alcohol use. NSAIDs modified the association of alcohol consumption with rectal cancer: 1) risk associated with beer increased among men who did not take NSAIDs and had a high beer intake (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.39) and 2) risk associated with long-term alcohol intake increased in a linear fashion in women who did not use NSAIDs (OR = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.15, 3.40). Risk of rectal cancer increased among estrogen-negative women if they consumed any beer or white wine but decreased among estrogen-positive women with beer. In men, low intake of water and low insoluble fiber intake were associated with increased risk of rectal cancer beyond that of either factor alone (OR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.11, 3.00). The interactions of fiber with water intake suggest that bowel motility may be the mechanism responsible for modification of rectal cancer risk for water. Associations of alcohol to risk for rectal cancer may be related to cellular hyperproliferation and may be modified by NSAID use.

[INST]  Find all references to food within the text:   To evaluate the associations of changes in diet during adult life with adenoma risk, data from a case-control study of 146 colorectal adenomas and 226 controls were analyzed. Dietary habits during the year before sigmoidoscopy and when subjects were 30 yr old were collected using a food-frequency questionnaire. Change in frequency of consumption during adulthood was calculated by subtracting frequency of consumption of specific foods or food groups at age 30 yr from frequency of consumption during the previous year (recent consumption). Associations with changes in frequency of consumption were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There was no association for foods or food groups consumed at age 30 yr. For recent consumption, more frequent consumption of red meat, breakfast sausage, and pork chops/ham steaks and less frequent consumption of fish, chicken/turkey, and vegetables were related to a higher risk. Compared with individuals with the highest reduction in consumption since age 30 yr, risks were higher for those with smallest reduction in red meat intake (OR = 2.8; CI = 1.1-7.3), particularly for hamburgers/cheeseburgers (OR = 2.8; CI = 1.2-6.8) and pork chops/ham steaks (OR = 3.7; CI = 1.6-8.7). In contrast, individuals in the highest quartile of increased consumption of fish (OR = 0.6; CI = 0.3-1.1) and vegetables (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.3-1.1) had a lower risk compared with those with minimal increase in consumption. In conclusion, irrespective of frequency of consumption at age 30 yr, a greater reduction in consumption of red meat and a larger increase in consumption of vegetables since age 30 yr were associated with a decreased risk of colorectal adenomas later in life.

[INST]  Retrieve all food-related terms contained in the text:   Intake in the morning is associated with a reduction in the total intake for the day, while intake at night is associated with greater overall daily intake. These associations are macronutrient specific, with morning carbohydrate intake associated with reduced daily carbohydrate intake, morning fat intake associated with reduced daily fat intake and morning protein intake associated with reduced daily protein intake. Since different types of foods contain differing proportions of macronutrients, the present study investigated the associations of different types of foods ingested at various times of day with total daily and macronutrient intakes. The intakes of 388 male and 621 female free-living individuals reported in 7 d diet diaries were reanalysed. The intakes of twenty-four different types of foods and seven different drinks occurring during the morning (04.00-10.29 hours), afternoon (10.30-16.59 hours) and evening (17.00-02.00 hours) were identified and related to overall daily intakes. Dairy foods, ice cream, beef, other meats, potatoes, pastry, nuts, chips and snacks, condiments, alcohol and soda were significantly associated with higher total intake over the day, while fruit, soup, breakfast cereal, pasta, pizza, water, coffee/tea and diet soda were either not associated or were associated with lower overall intake. Dietary energy density appeared to mediate the associations between particular foods and beverages and overall energy intake. This suggests that eating low-density foods in the morning and avoiding high-density foods at night might aid in reducing overall intake and may be useful in dietary interventions for overweight and obesity.

This study was conducted to identify associations between total sugar intake and sugar intake from different foods (fruit, milk, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)), and adiposity and continuous metabolic syndrome scores (cMetS) among Korean children and adolescents using cohort data. The study subjects were children (n = 770) who participated in the 4th year (2008) of the Korean Child-Adolescent Cohort Study (KoCAS). Dietary intake data were collected via three-day 24-h food records, and sugar intake was calculated for the total sugar content of foods using our database compiled from various sources. Anthropometric measurements, assessments of body composition, and blood sample analysis were performed at baseline and at follow-up four years later. The cMetS was calculated based on waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, and mean arterial blood pressure. According to multiple linear regression analysis, there were no significant associations between total sugar intake and adiposity and cMetS. However, higher intake of fruit sugar at baseline was significantly associated with lower body mass index (BMI) z-scores and body fat percentages at baseline (<U+03B2> = -0.10, p = 0.02 and <U+03B2> = -0.78, p < 0.01, respectively). At follow-up, sugar intake from fruit at baseline was still negatively associated with the above outcomes, but only the relationship with BMI z-scores retained statistical significance (<U+03B2> = -0.08, p < 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between consumption of sugar from SSBs and cMetS at baseline (<U+03B2> = 0.04, p = 0.02), but that relationship was not observed at follow-up (p = 0.83). Differences in consumption sugars from fruit and SSBs might play an important role in the risk of adiposity and metabolic disease in children and adolescents. Our results suggest that strategies for reducing sugar intake need to target particular food groups. Consequently, this information could be of value to obesity- and metabolic disease-prevention strategies.

Wheat flour samples (82% extraction rate) and soy bean flour were analyzed to determine their folic acid contents using the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Unfortified and folic acid fortified Baladi breads were prepared. Samples from each step of bread preparation were analyzed for folic acid concentration. Protein, fat, ash, fibers and carbohydrates percentages were also determined. Rats were divided into five groups, four of them were injected subcutaneously with dimethylhydrazine (DMH). After 15 weeks, the rats were sacrificed for pathological examination. Results showed that the folic acid content in wheat flour (82% extraction rate) was found to be highly significantly lower than that in soybean flour. After baking, folic acid content in all breads was found to decrease significantly. The highest protein and fat contents were found in soybean flour fortified Baladi bread. The colons of rats of groups 3 (fed 5% soy flour fortified Baladi bread) and 5 (fed Baladi bread fortified with 5% soy flour+8 mg folic acid/kg wheat flour) were the mostly affected by DMH injection as premalignant changes were observed.

Patients with chronic diseases, including diabetes, use NHPs at a higher rate than the general population. Many NHPs exert hypoglycemic effects, among other effects relevant to diabetes management. To provide a practical, clinical review of NHPs with such effects targeted to pharmacists, a literature search was performed to collect data on the efficacy and safety profiles of 10 commonly used NHPs that exert antidiabetic properties. The following NHPs are included in this clinical review: alpha-lipoic acid, chromium, magnesium, bitter melon, cinnamon, fenugreek, gymnema, milk thistle, Reishi mushroom and white mulberry. Given the potential of NHPs to additively cause hypoglycemia when used concurrently with conventional medications, pharmacists should be up to date with current evidence around NHPs that may affect diabetes care to prevent adverse reactions and interactions.

Skin prick tests and RAST were performed on 79 consecutive patients with tree pollinosis, visiting the department of allergology during spring 1995. In skin prick tests, we used three different extracts (juice, freeze-dried extract, and low-temperature acetone powder extract) of two apple strains, Golden Delicious and Granny Smith. Case histories for apple, peach, and hazelnut were positive in 35 (44.3%), 23 (29%), and 35 (44.3%) patients, respectively. More than two-thirds of the patients had symptoms characteristic of oral allergy syndrome. Skin prick tests for apple, peach, and hazelnut were positive in 51 (64.6%), 61 (77.2%), and 71 (89.9%) patients, respectively. Granny Smith showed more positive skin reactions and a better agreement with clinical history than Golden Delicious, and juice was superior to the two other extraction procedures for both apple strains. RAST for apple, peach, and hazelnut was positive in 53 (68.8%), 13 (16.9%), and 31 (40.3%) patients, respectively. Concordance between skin prick test and case history was found in 77%, 52%, and 54%, for apple, peach, and hazelnut, respectively. We found a high percentage of concurrence of clinical allergy to birch pollen and apple, peach, and hazelnut, confirmed by both skin prick testing and RAST. Approximately half of these patients had symptoms (especially oral allergy syndrome) after eating these products.

[INST]  Extract all food-related entities from the text:   Chocolate today is often viewed as a food or snack with little nutritional value. The high saturated fat content of chocolate has also contributed to the belief that its consumption increases the risk of heart disease. However, recent human studies have proven that chocolate has beneficial effects on some pathogenic mechanisms of heart disease such as endothelial function and blood pressure. Although the antioxidant properties of chocolate have been known for some time, there has been no examination of its place in the U.S. diet as a source of antioxidants. This paper demonstrates that chocolate makes a significant contribution to U.S. per capita dietary antioxidants and by inference the European Community's. In the U.S. diet chocolate is the third highest daily per capita antioxidant source. An ex vivo study shows that epicatechin, a major polyphenol in chocolate and chocolate extracts, is a powerful inhibitor of plasma lipid oxidation due to polyphenols' ability to bind to lower density lipoproteins. Conversely, the fat from chocolate alone is a pro-oxidant in this model. This is also demonstrated in an in vivo human study. After consumption of dark chocolate and cocoa powder, the lower density lipoproteins isolated from plasma were protected from oxidation compared to the lipoproteins isolated after cocoa butter consumption, which were put under oxidative stress. In an animal model of atherosclerosis, cocoa powder at a human dose equivalent of two dark chocolate bars per day significantly inhibited atherosclerosis, lowered cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, raised high-density lipoprotein, and protected the lower density lipoproteins from oxidation. Chocolate has thus been shown to have potential beneficial effects with respect to heart disease.

[INST]  Retrieve all mentions of food items from the text:   In the United States, the notion that low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets are essential for health has grown into an obsession, driven largely by an effort to reduce heart disease and, more recently, certain types of cancer. We know that saturated fatty acids are more closely associated with risk factors for heart disease than are unsaturated fatty acids. Many people believe that plant-based diets are healthy because they are low in fat. However, plant-based diets are not necessarily low-fat. In true plant-based diets, unsaturated fatty acids predominate, whereas saturated fatty acids come largely from animal sources such as dairy products and eggs. Plant-based diets include foods that contain fats, such as nuts and seeds and oils from grains and seeds. The fats in these foods are not associated with increased risk for heart disease. In addition, for people with insulin resistance, higher-fat diets protect against the heart disease risk factors of low HDL-cholesterol concentration, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia. Because humans can synthesize fat from dietary carbohydrate, and because our adipose stores and circulating fatty acids reflect dietary intake, scientists understand the relations between the amounts and types of dietary fats and the types of fats found in body fat depots. Consuming dietary fats that are not associated with increased risk of disease can be a part of a healthful diet.

Most Seventh-day Adventists do not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, and there is a wide range of dietary exposures within the population. About 50% of those studied ate meat products <1 time/wk or not at all, and vegetarians consumed more tomatoes, legumes, nuts, and fruit, but less coffee, doughnuts, and eggs than did nonvegetarians. Multivariate analyses showed significant associations between beef consumption and fatal ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men [relative risk (RR) = 2.31 for subjects who ate beef > or =3 times/wk compared with vegetarians], significant protective associations between nut consumption and fatal and nonfatal IHD in both sexes (RR approximately 0.5 for subjects who ate nuts > or =5 times/wk compared with those who ate nuts <1 time/wk), and reduced risk of IHD in subjects preferring whole-grain to white bread. The lifetime risk of IHD was reduced by approximately 31% in those who consumed nuts frequently and by 37% in male vegetarians compared with nonvegetarians. Cancers of the colon and prostate were significantly more likely in nonvegetarians (RR of 1.88 and 1.54, respectively), and frequent beef consumers also had higher risk of bladder cancer. Intake of legumes was negatively associated with risk of colon cancer in nonvegetarians and risk of pancreatic cancer. Higher consumption of all fruit or dried fruit was associated with lower risks of lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Cross-sectional data suggest vegetarian Seventh-day Adventists have lower risks of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and arthritis than nonvegetarians. Thus, among Seventh-day Adventists, vegetarians are healthier than nonvegetarians but this cannot be ascribed only to the absence of meat.

Although acute trials show reductions in postprandial glycemia in healthy individuals ingesting 60 to 90 g almonds, trials have not been conducted using a single serving of almonds (28 g) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This randomized crossover trial examined the impact of one serving of almonds at mealtime on postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 in healthy individuals and individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. On 2 occasions separated by at least 1 week, 19 adults (including 7 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus) consumed a standardized evening meal and fasted overnight before ingesting the test meal (bagel, juice, and butter) with or without almonds. A small pilot study (6-7 subjects per group) was also conducted to observe whether chronic almond ingestion (1 serving 5 d/wk for 12 weeks) lowered hemoglobin A(1c) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A standard serving of almonds reduced postprandial glycemia significantly in participants with diabetes (-30%, P = .043) but did not influence glycemia in participants without diabetes (-7%, P = .638). Insulinemia and glucagon-like peptide-1 at 30 minutes postmeal were not impacted by almond ingestion for either group. In the pilot study, regular almond ingestion for 12 weeks reduced hemoglobin A(1c) by 4% (P = .045 for interaction) but did not influence fasting glucose concentrations. These data show that modest almond consumption favorably improves both short-term and long-term markers of glucose control in individuals with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Information was collected about smoking history and alcohol and dietary intake. After 24 years, 92 incident cases with histological confirmation of diagnosis were identified. Current cigarette smokers at time of examination had a 3-fold risk for upper aerodigestive tract cancer compared with never-smokers. A dose-response relationship was present with increasing amount and duration of cigarette use. Consumption of beer, wine, spirits and total alcohol was strongly associated with increased risk. Of 23 food and beverage categories, only candy/jelly/soda pop consumption had a statistically significant inverse trend. Frequent consumption of fruit was also inversely associated with this cancer. In contrast, the risk tended to be positively associated with consumption of rice, seaweed, tofu or tsukudani (a mixed dish of fish, sugar, soy sauce and seaweed), but the dose-response relationship was not statistically significant.

The panel of food products tested included fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs and spices, most of which are common in a normal European-style diet. The impact of these extracts on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacteria lactis) and pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and Escherichia coli LF82) was assessed using a standard minimum inhibitory concentration method. The results showed that aqueous extractions of garlic and black peppercorns significantly enhanced the growth of one strain of probiotic bacteria (L. reuteri) whilst inhibiting both pathogenic strains of E. coli at a 1:50 dilution. Aqueous extracts of banana, apple and orange all enhanced the growth of the three probiotic strains significantly, and inhibited the pathogens to approximately 80% of the controls (not significant).

Although several plant parts have potentials for chemoprevention and other therapeutic use, their molecular mechanisms of action are not always well understood. Extensive research has identified several molecular targets that can potentially be used for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer. In this review, we accumulate evidences of modulating abilities of some dietary plants and their products on several signaling pathways, including the inflammatory and apoptotic ones, which may be targeted for cancer therapy. We have mainly focused on several phytochemicals like resveratrol (red grapes and peanuts), allicin (garlic), lycopene (tomato), indole-3-carbinol (cruciferous vegetables), vitamin C (citrus fruits), [6]-gingerol (ginger), emodin (aloe), natural antioxidant mixture (spinach), beta carotenoids (carrots), sulphoraphane (mustard), ellagic acid (pomegranate), myrecitin (cranberry), carnosol (rosemary), vanillin (vanilla) and eugenol (cloves). They act through one or more signaling pathways like nuclear factor kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, Akt, mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase, Bcl-2, caspases, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, matrix metalloproteinase 2/9, and cyclin D1.

[INST]  Identify all food entities contained in the text:   Epidemiological studies have observed a negative association between tomato intake and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. As tomato sauces are usually cooked with the addition of oil, some studies have pointed out that both processes may increase the bioavailability of the bioactive compounds. However, the effect of consumption of raw tomatoes and tomato sauces on inflammation biomarkers and adhesion molecules related to atherosclerosis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to test the postprandial effects of a single dose of raw tomatoes (RT), tomato sauce (TS) and tomato sauce with refined olive oil (TSOO) on cardiovascular disease risk factors. We performed an open, prospective, randomized, cross-over, controlled feeding trial in 40 healthy subjects who randomly received: 7.0 g of RT/kg of body weight (BW), 3.5 g of TS/kg BW, 3.5 g of TSOO/Kg BW and 0.25 g of sugar solved in water/kg BW on a single occasion on four different days. Biochemical parameters and cellular and circulating inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at baseline and 6 h after each intervention. The results indicate that, compared to control intervention, a single tomato intake in any form decreased plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and several cellular and plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and increased plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and interleukine (IL) 10 concentrations. However, the changes of plasma IL-6 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) from T-lymphocytes and CD36 from monocytes were significantly greater after TSOO than after RT and TS interventions.

[INST]  Find all mentions of food-related entities in the text:   Cancer initiation and progression are the result of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations. Acetylation-mediated histone/non-histone protein modification plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Histone modification is controlled by the balance between histone acetyltransferase and (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. Imbalance between the activities of these two enzymes is associated with various forms of cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) regulate the activity of HDACs and are being used in cancer treatment either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs/radiotherapy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved four compounds, namely vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, and panobinostat, as HDACi for the treatment of cancer. Several other HDACi of natural and synthetic origin are under clinical trial for the evaluation of efficiency and side-effects. Natural compounds of plant, fungus, and actinomycetes origin, such as phenolics, polyketides, tetrapeptide, terpenoids, alkaloids, and hydoxamic acid, have been reported to show potential HDAC-inhibitory activity. Several HDACi of natural and dietary origin are butein, protocatechuic aldehyde, kaempferol (grapes, green tea, tomatoes, potatoes, and onions), resveratrol (grapes, red wine, blueberries and peanuts), sinapinic acid (wine and vinegar), diallyl disulfide (garlic), and zerumbone (ginger). HDACi exhibit their antitumor effect by the activation of cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and autophagy, angiogenesis inhibition, increased reactive oxygen species generation causing oxidative stress, and mitotic cell death in cancer cells. This review summarizes the HDACs classification, their aberrant expression in cancerous tissue, structures, sources, and the anticancer mechanisms of HDACi, as well as HDACi that are either FDA-approved or under clinical trials.

[INST]  Find all food entities present in the text:   The formulation of gluten-free bread, which will be suitable for patients with coeliac disease, was optimized to provide bread similar to French bread. The effects of the presence of hydrocolloids and the substitution of the flour basis by flour or proteins from different sources were studied. The added ingredients were (1) hydrocolloids (carboxymethylcellulose [CMC], guar gum, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose [HPMC], and xanthan gum), and (2) substitutes (buckwheat flour, whole egg powder, and whey proteins). The bread quality parameters measured were specific volume, dry matter of bread, crust color, crumb hardness, and gas cell size distribution. Specific volume was increased by guar gum and HPMC. Breads with guar gum had color characteristics similar to French bread. Hardness decreased with the addition of hydrocolloids, especially HPMC and guar. Breads with guar gum had the most heterogeneous cell size distribution, and guar gum was therefore selected for further formulations. Bread prepared with buckwheat flour had improved quality: an increased specific volume, a softer texture, color characteristics, and gas-cell size distribution similar to French bread. Bread with 1.9% guar gum (w/w, total flour basis) and 5% buckwheat flour (of all flours and substitutes) mimicked French bread quality attributes.

[INST]  Identify all food items referenced in the text:   The present study demonstrated that the zinc concentration in bovine milk and blood plasma is significantly affected by the intake of saturated fat supplements. Sixteen Holstein cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with 4 periods of 12 d, and 4 dietary treatments were conducted. A total mixed ration based on corn silage, grass-clover silages, and pelleted sugar beet pulp was used on all treatments. A high de novo milk fat diet was formulated by adding rapeseed meal and molasses in the total mixed ration [39 mg of Zn/kg of dry matter (DM)], and a low de novo diet by adding saturated fat, fat-rich rapeseed cake, and corn (34 mg of Zn/kg of DM). Dietary Zn levels were increased by addition of ZnO to 83 and 80 mg of Zn/kg of DM. Treatments did not affect daily DM intake, or yield of energy-corrected milk, milk fat, or milk protein. The high de novo diet significantly increased milk fat percentage and milk content of fatty acids with chain length from C6 to C16, and decreased content of C18 and C18:1. Treatments did not influence milk free fatty acids at 4 degrees C at 0 or 28 h after milking. The average diameter of milk fat globules was significantly greater in milk from cows offered low de novo diets. Furthermore, the low de novo diet significantly increased the concentration of nonesterified fatty acids and d-beta-hydroxybutyrate in blood plasma, the latter was also increased in milk. Treatments did not affect the enzyme activity of lactate dehydrogenase and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase in milk or the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in blood plasma. The low de novo diet significantly increased plasma Zn and milk Zn content, whereas dietary Zn level did not in itself influence these parameters. This indicates that the transfer of fat from diet to milk might facilitate transfer of Zn from diet to milk.

[INST]  Identify all food-related entities present in the text:   Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the second most common cancer diagnosed in Algeria. The incidence and the mortality rate of CRC have increased so that the nation now ranks third in Africa in both these variables. Many environmental and genetic factors are suspected to play an important role in the development of the disease. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for CRC in Algeria. We performed a case-control study in five Medical Oncology Services in this region: Tebessa, Batna, Annaba, Setif, and Constantine, from 2016 to 2019. Altogether, 200 patients diagnosed with CRC and 200 age-matched controls without any diagnosis of cancer were included. Study participants were interviewed about environmental, dietary, and hereditary risk factors, i.e., family history of cancer, using a questionnaire. Results showed a significant association between high educational level and a decreased risk of CRC. Diagnoses of any cancer or of CRC in first-degree or in second- or third-degree relatives also were significantly associated with CRC risk. Occupational exposures showed a significant link with an increased risk of CRC, as did obesity, alcohol consumption, and passive smoking. Yogurt, cereals, sugar, butter, and margarine consumption were significant protective factors, while cheese, dried fruits, red meat, juice, and fizzy drink consumption was associated with increased risk. Our findings suggest a benefit of public health campaigns to enhance awareness about CRC and to encourage healthy dietary choices and avoidance of non-dietary risk factors.
